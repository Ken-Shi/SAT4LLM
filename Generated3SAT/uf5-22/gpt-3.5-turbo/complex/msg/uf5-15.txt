To solve this SAT problem, we will use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment. However, we can also try to simplify the problem manually.

First, let's analyze the clauses provided:
1. -1 -5 -3
2. -3 -2 -4
3. -2 4 -3
4. -3 -4 -2
5. -5 -2 3
6. -3 -1 2
7. -5 -4 2
8. -3 -4 -1
9. 2 -3 -5
10. -3 -1 -2
11. -4 -3 -5
12. -2 -3 5
13. -4 -3 -5
14. -4 -1 -5
15. -4 -2 -3
16. -4 -2 1
17. -1 -4 -2
18. -4 5 -1
19. -4 -1 -5
20. -4 -2 -3
21. 2 -3 -4
22. -5 -1 -3

Since there are 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and 22 clauses, this problem is relatively small and can be solved efficiently using a SAT solver.

Now, let's find a satisfying assignment:
answer: 1 -2 -3 -4 -5
