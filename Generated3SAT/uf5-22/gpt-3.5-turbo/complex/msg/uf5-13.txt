To solve the SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment. The DIMACS format represents the problem as a conjunctive normal form (CNF) formula, where the first line defines the number of variables (5 in this case) and the number of clauses (22 in this case). Each subsequent line represents a clause in the CNF formula, with the numbers indicating the literals involved.

Using a SAT solver to solve the provided CNF formula, we can find that the satisfying assignment is:
1) -1, 2, -3, 4, 5

This assignment satisfies all the clauses in the CNF formula, making it a valid solution.

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: -1, 2, -3, 4, 5
