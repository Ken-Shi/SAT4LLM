To solve the SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use the following steps:
1. Initialize an empty list to store the assignments for the variables.
2. Check each clause one by one to see if there is at least one literal that is satisfied for each clause.
3. If a clause is satisfied, mark it as True and move on to the next clause.
4. If a clause is not satisfied, try to satisfy it with an assignment of True or False to one of its variables. Store the assignment.
5. Continue with step 2 until all clauses are satisfied or no more assignments can be made.
6. If all clauses are satisfied, return the assignments that satisfy the problem. If no assignments satisfy all clauses, the problem is unsatisfiable.

The SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format is:
p cnf 5 22
4 -2 3 0
-1 5 3 0
2 4 3 0
-5 4 -1 0
-2 -1 5 0
-1 4 -2 0
-1 4 -2 0
-4 -2 5 0
4 -5 3 0
3 1 4 0
3 -2 -1 0
-1 -4 3 0
1 4 5 0
-1 -2 5 0
3 -1 5 0
4 -1 -5 0
3 2 -4 0
3 -2 5 0
4 3 5 0
3 -2 -1 0
-1 4 3 0
5 -2 4 0

Using the steps above, let's solve the SAT problem:

Clause 1: 4 -2 3 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 4, -2)
Clause 2: -1 5 3 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables -1, 5)
Clause 3: 2 4 3 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 2, 4)
Clause 4: -5 4 -1 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables -5, 4)
Clause 5: -2 -1 5 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables -2, -1)
Clause 6: -1 4 -2 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables -1, 4)
Clause 7: -1 4 -2 (Already Satisfied)
Clause 8: -4 -2 5 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables -4, -2)
Clause 9: 4 -5 3 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 4, -5)
Clause 10: 3 1 4 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 3, 1)
Clause 11: 3 -2 -1 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 3, -2)
Clause 12: -1 -4 3 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables -1, -4)
Clause 13: 1 4 5 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 1, 4)
Clause 14: -1 -2 5 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables -1, -2)
Clause 15: 3 -1 5 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 3, -1)
Clause 16: 4 -1 -5 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 4, -1)
Clause 17: 3 2 -4 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 3, 2)
Clause 18: 3 -2 5 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 3, -2)
Clause 19: 4 3 5 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 4, 3)
Clause 20: 3 -2 -1 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 3, -2)
Clause 21: -1 4 3 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables -1, 4)
Clause 22: 5 -2 4 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 5, -2)

Therefore, the solution to the SAT problem is:
answer: 4 -2 3 -1 5
