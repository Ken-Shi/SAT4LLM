To solve this SAT problem, we need to identify the combination of variables that would satisfy all of the clauses given in the DIMACS format. 

From the given clauses, we can see that the following assignment would satisfy all the clauses:
- Make variable 1 True
- Make variable 2 True
- Make variable 3 True
- Make variable 4 True
- Make variable 5 False

This assignment satisfies all the clauses in the SAT problem. 

Therefore, the solution to the SAT problem is:
answer: 1 2 3 4 -5
