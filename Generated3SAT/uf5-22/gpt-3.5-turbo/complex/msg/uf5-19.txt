To solve this SAT problem, let's convert the DIMACS format to a more readable format:

1. (3 OR 5 OR -1)
2. (-1 OR -2 OR 5)
3. (4 OR -3 OR -1)
4. (5 OR -4 OR -1)
5. (5 OR -1 OR 4)
6. (4 OR -1 OR 5)
7. (4 OR -1 OR 5)
8. (3 OR -1 OR 4)
9. (4 OR -2 OR -1)
10. (3 OR 5 OR -4)
11. (-4 OR 5 OR -1)
12. (4 OR 5 OR -1)
13. (5 OR 4 OR -1)
14. (-3 OR 4 OR 5)
15. (5 OR 2 OR -1)
16. (3 OR -2 OR -1)
17. (5 OR -1 OR -3)
18. (-1 OR -3 OR 5)
19. (1 OR -2 OR -3)
20. (5 OR 4 OR -2)
21. (-1 OR -3 OR -2)
22. (-4 OR -3 OR -1)

Now, we will apply the resolution method to find a solution if one exists.

Let's start by looking at the clauses and resolve those that have complementary literals. For example, from clause 1 and 3, we can resolve on -1:

1. (3 OR 5)
2. (-1 OR -2 OR 5)
4. (5 OR -4)

Now, resolve on 5 between clauses 1 and 2:

1. (3)
2. (-1 OR -2)
4. (-4)

Then, resolve on -4 between clauses 2 and 4:

1. (3)
2. (-1 OR -2)
 
Next, resolve on -1 between clauses 2 and 1:

1. (3)
 
Since we are left with clause 1 (3), the solution is that variables 3 must be true for the given formula to be satisfiable.

Therefore, 
answer: 3
