To solve this SAT problem, we need to find a satisfying assignment that makes all the clauses true. Let's simplify the problem by representing it in a more readable format:

1. (3, -4, 1)
2. (1, -3, 4)
3. (-5, -2, 4)
4. (-3, -2, -1)
5. (-2, -5, -4)
6. (4, -5, 1)
7. (1, -3, -4)
8. (-3, 1, -5)
9. (2, 1, 4)
10. (2, 4, -3)
11. (-5, 1, -3)
12. (-3, -5, 1)
13. (-2, 5, 4)
14. (3, 4, 1)
15. (-5, 1, -3)
16. (5, 4, -3)
17. (-3, -2, 5)
18. (-5, 1, 4)
19. (-3, 2, 4)
20. (-2, -5, 4)
21. (4, 1, -2)
22. (-2, 1, -3)

Now, let's try to find a satisfying assignment using the resolution method:

1. From clause 3, we have (-5, -2, 4). To satisfy this clause, we must assign -2 to true.
2. From clause 4, we have (-3, -2, -1). Since we have assigned -2 to true, we must assign -3 to false.
3. From clause 8, we have (-3, 1, -5). Since we have assigned -3 to false, we must assign 1 to false.
4. From clause 1, we have (3, -4, 1). Since we have assigned 1 to false, we must assign 3 to true.
5. From clause 6, we have (4, -5, 1). Since we have assigned 1 to false, we must assign 4 to true.
6. From clause 13, we have (-2, 5, 4). Since we have assigned -2 to true and 4 to true, we must assign 5 to true.
7. From clause 14, we have (3, 4, 1). Since we have assigned 3 to true, 4 to true, we must assign 1 to true.

Therefore, a possible satisfying assignment is:
1. -3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

answer: -3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
