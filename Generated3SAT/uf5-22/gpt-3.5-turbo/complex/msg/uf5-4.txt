To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. 

We first need to convert the DIMACS format into a more readable format. The problem is encoded with 5 variables and 22 clauses:

1. ?x2 ? ?x3 ? x1
2. x1 ? x4 ? ?x2
3. x1 ? x3 ? x4
4. x1 ? ?x5 ? x2
5. ?x4 ? ?x2 ? ?x3
6. x4 ? ?x3 ? x1
7. ?x3 ? ?x4 ? x5
8. ?x2 ? x5 ? x3
9. x5 ? ?x2 ? x3
10. x4 ? ?x3 ? x1
11. ?x3 ? x5 ? x4
12. x5 ? x4 ? x1
13. x1 ? ?x3 ? x4
14. x1 ? x5 ? x4
15. x1 ? ?x3 ? x5
16. x5 ? x4 ? ?x3
17. x4 ? x1 ? ?x2
18. ?x3 ? x1 ? ?x4
19. ?x3 ? x5 ? ?x4
20. ?x5 ? x1 ? x3
21. x5 ? x1 ? ?x4
22. x5 ? x4 ? ?x3

Now, we can start the DPLL algorithm to find a satisfying assignment for the formula.

Let's start by setting all variables to false:
x1 = False
x2 = False
x3 = False
x4 = False
x5 = False

We'll now iterate through the clauses to check for unit clauses or pure literals and assign values accordingly.
- From clause 2, we see that x1 must be true.
- From clause 9, we see that x5 must be true.
- From clause 1, we see that x3 must be true.
- From clause 4, we see that x2 must be true.

Therefore, the satisfying assignment for this problem is:
x1 = True
x2 = True
x3 = True
x4 = False
x5 = True

answer: x1 = 1, x2 = 1, x3 = 1, x4 = 0, x5 = 1
