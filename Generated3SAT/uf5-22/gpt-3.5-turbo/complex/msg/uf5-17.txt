To solve this SAT problem, we can use a SAT solver such as MiniSat or Z3. Alternatively, we can manually analyze the clauses to find a satisfying assignment.

Looking at the DIMACS format, we have 5 variables and 22 clauses. Let's analyze the clauses:

1. The first three clauses fix the value of variables 1, 3, 4, and 5 together.
2. The fourth and fifth clauses fix the value of variable 2 together with either variables 1 or 4.
3. The sixth clause fixes the value of variable 2 together with variables 1 and 3.
4. The seventh clause fixes the value of variable 2 together with negative values of variables 3, 4, and 5.
5. The eighth and ninth clauses fix the value of variable 2 for the remaining combinations.

Based on the above analysis, we can see that variables 1, 3, 4, and 5 have interdependent relationships. Let's determine the possible solutions:

1. If variables 1, 3, 4, and 5 are true, then variable 2 must be false to satisfy the clauses.
2. If variables 1, 3, 4, and 5 are false, then variable 2 must be true to satisfy the clauses.

Therefore, the satisfying assignment is:
- Variable 1 = True
- Variable 2 = False
- Variable 3 = True
- Variable 4 = True
- Variable 5 = True

answer: 1 0 -1 -2 4
