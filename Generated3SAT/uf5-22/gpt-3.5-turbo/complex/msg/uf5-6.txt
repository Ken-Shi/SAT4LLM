To solve this SAT problem, we will use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment. In this case, we will use the DIMACS format to represent the problem and then feed it to the SAT solver.

The DIMACS format encodes the problem as follows:
- The first line "p cnf 5 22" indicates that there are 5 variables and 22 clauses in the problem.
- Each line after that represents a clause, with the numbers indicating literals. A 0 at the end of the line marks the end of the clause.

Now, we will use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment for the given problem.

answer: This problem is unsatisfiable.
