To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to analyze each clause and see if there is a combination of variable assignments that satisfy all clauses simultaneously. 

The variables are represented with numbers from 1 to 5. Negation of a variable is represented by a negative sign (-). 

Let's analyze the clauses:
1. -4 5 3: The clause is satisfied if we assign true to 5 and 3, which makes the clause true.
2. -3 4 -1: The clause is satisfied if we assign true to 4, which makes the clause true.
3. -4 -1 3: The clause is satisfied if we assign true to 3, which makes the clause true.
4. 2 5 -4: The clause is satisfied if we assign true to 2, 5, which makes the clause true.
5. 5 -2 3: The clause is satisfied if we assign true to 5, 3, which makes the clause true.
6. 4 -5 -1: The clause is satisfied if we assign true to 4, which makes the clause true.
7. -2 -4 3: The clause is satisfied if we assign true to 3, which makes the clause true.
8. -1 -4 2: The clause is satisfied if we assign true to 2, which makes the clause true.
9. -2 4 5: The clause is satisfied if we assign true to 4, 5, which makes the clause true.
10. 5 -4 -1: The clause is satisfied if we assign true to 5, which makes the clause true.
11. 1 5 2: The clause is satisfied if we assign true to 1, 5, 2, which makes the clause true.
12. -1 2 -4: The clause is satisfied if we assign true to 2, which makes the clause true.
13. 5 3 1: The clause is satisfied if we assign true to 5, 3, 1, which makes the clause true.
14. 4 1 3: The clause is satisfied if we assign true to 4, 1, 3, which makes the clause true.
15. 2 -1 -5: The clause is satisfied if we assign true to 2, which makes the clause true.
16. 2 -1 5: The clause is satisfied if we assign true to 2, 5, which makes the clause true.
17. -1 -4 5: The clause is satisfied if we assign true to 5, which makes the clause true.
18. -1 -4 2: The clause is satisfied if we assign true to 2, which makes the clause true.
19. 5 -1 2: The clause is satisfied if we assign true to 5, 2, which makes the clause true.
20. 2 3 -4: The clause is satisfied if we assign true to 2, 3, which makes the clause true.
21. 2 -1 5: The clause is satisfied if we assign true to 2, 5, which makes the clause true.
22. 5 3 -1: The clause is satisfied if we assign true to 5, 3, which makes the clause true.

Since all the clauses have combinations that can be satisfied, the final answer is:
answer: 2 5 3
