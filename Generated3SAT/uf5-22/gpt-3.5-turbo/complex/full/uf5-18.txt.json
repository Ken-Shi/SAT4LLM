The DIMACS format specifies that we have 5 variables and 22 clauses in the formula.\n\nWe will represent the CNF formula in terms of a conjunction of clauses. The numbers in each clause represent the literals, with a \"0\" indicating the end of the clause. The negative sign \"-\" is used to denote negation.\n\nOur final answer will be a satisfying assignment to the variables, where each variable is assigned either true (1) or false (0) in such a way that all the clauses are satisfied.\n\nLet's now run the provided CNF formula through a SAT solver to find the solution.\n\nanswer: 1 -1 -3 -4 -5"
