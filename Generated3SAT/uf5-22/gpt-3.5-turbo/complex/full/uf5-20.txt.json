Check each clause one by one to see if there is at least one literal that is satisfied for each clause.\n3. If a clause is satisfied, mark it as True and move on to the next clause.\n4. If a clause is not satisfied, try to satisfy it with an assignment of True or False to one of its variables. Store the assignment.\n5. Continue with step 2 until all clauses are satisfied or no more assignments can be made.\n6. If all clauses are satisfied, return the assignments that satisfy the problem. If no assignments satisfy all clauses, the problem is unsatisfiable.\n\nThe SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format is:\np cnf 5 22\n4 -2 3 0\n-1 5 3 0\n2 4 3 0\n-5 4 -1 0\n-2 -1 5 0\n-1 4 -2 0\n-1 4 -2 0\n-4 -2 5 0\n4 -5 3 0\n3 1 4 0\n3 -2 -1 0\n-1 -4 3 0\n1 4 5 0\n-1 -2 5 0\n3 -1 5 0\n4 -1 -5 0\n3 2 -4 0\n3 -2 5 0\n4 3 5 0\n3 -2 -1 0\n-1 4 3 0\n5 -2 4 0\n\nUsing the steps above, let's solve the SAT problem:\n\nClause 1: 4 -2 3 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 4, -2)\nClause 2: -1 5 3 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables -1, 5)\nClause 3: 2 4 3 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 2, 4)\nClause 4: -5 4 -1 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables -5, 4)\nClause 5: -2 -1 5 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables -2, -1)\nClause 6: -1 4 -2 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables -1, 4)\nClause 7: -1 4 -2 (Already Satisfied)\nClause 8: -4 -2 5 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables -4, -2)\nClause 9: 4 -5 3 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 4, -5)\nClause 10: 3 1 4 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 3, 1)\nClause 11: 3 -2 -1 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 3, -2)\nClause 12: -1 -4 3 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables -1, -4)\nClause 13: 1 4 5 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 1, 4)\nClause 14: -1 -2 5 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables -1, -2)\nClause 15: 3 -1 5 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 3, -1)\nClause 16: 4 -1 -5 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 4, -1)\nClause 17: 3 2 -4 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 3, 2)\nClause 18: 3 -2 5 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 3, -2)\nClause 19: 4 3 5 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 4, 3)\nClause 20: 3 -2 -1 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 3, -2)\nClause 21: -1 4 3 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables -1, 4)\nClause 22: 5 -2 4 (Satisfied by assigning True to variables 5, -2)\n\nTherefore, the solution to the SAT problem is:\nanswer: 4 -2 3 -1 5"
