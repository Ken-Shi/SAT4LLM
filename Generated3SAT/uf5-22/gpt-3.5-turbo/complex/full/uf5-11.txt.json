Let's simplify the problem by representing it in a more readable format:\n\n1. (3, -4, 1)\n2. (1, -3, 4)\n3. (-5, -2, 4)\n4. (-3, -2, -1)\n5. (-2, -5, -4)\n6. (4, -5, 1)\n7. (1, -3, -4)\n8. (-3, 1, -5)\n9. (2, 1, 4)\n10. (2, 4, -3)\n11. (-5, 1, -3)\n12. (-3, -5, 1)\n13. (-2, 5, 4)\n14. (3, 4, 1)\n15. (-5, 1, -3)\n16. (5, 4, -3)\n17. (-3, -2, 5)\n18. (-5, 1, 4)\n19. (-3, 2, 4)\n20. (-2, -5, 4)\n21. (4, 1, -2)\n22. (-2, 1, -3)\n\nNow, let's try to find a satisfying assignment using the resolution method:\n\n1. From clause 3, we have (-5, -2, 4). To satisfy this clause, we must assign -2 to true.\n2. From clause 4, we have (-3, -2, -1). Since we have assigned -2 to true, we must assign -3 to false.\n3. From clause 8, we have (-3, 1, -5). Since we have assigned -3 to false, we must assign 1 to false.\n4. From clause 1, we have (3, -4, 1). Since we have assigned 1 to false, we must assign 3 to true.\n5. From clause 6, we have (4, -5, 1). Since we have assigned 1 to false, we must assign 4 to true.\n6. From clause 13, we have (-2, 5, 4). Since we have assigned -2 to true and 4 to true, we must assign 5 to true.\n7. From clause 14, we have (3, 4, 1). Since we have assigned 3 to true, 4 to true, we must assign 1 to true.\n\nTherefore, a possible satisfying assignment is:\n1. -3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nanswer: -3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5"
