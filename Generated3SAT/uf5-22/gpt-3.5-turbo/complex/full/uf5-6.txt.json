In this case, we will use the DIMACS format to represent the problem and then feed it to the SAT solver.\n\nThe DIMACS format encodes the problem as follows:\n- The first line \"p cnf 5 22\" indicates that there are 5 variables and 22 clauses in the problem.\n- Each line after that represents a clause, with the numbers indicating literals. A 0 at the end of the line marks the end of the clause.\n\nNow, we will use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment for the given problem.\n\nanswer: This problem is unsatisfiable."
