To decode the SAT problem, let's review the DIMACS format first. 

In DIMACS Encoding:
- p cnf 5 22 -> p cnf specifies the problem is in cnf form, '5' is the total number of variables and '22' is the total number of clauses.
- Each line after `p cnf 5 22` represents a clause, until '0', which denotes the end of a clause. Each clause is a disjunction ('or') of literals.
- Each number represents a literal. A positive number represents the variable, while a negative number represents the negation of the variable (e.g., 1 represents variable `v1` and -1 represents `not v1`). 

To start solving the problem, we need to solve it clause by clause. Looking at all the clauses, the first observation is none of them contain a single literal (unit clause), so the unit clause method cannot be applied directly.

Therefore, we will use the DP algorithm-based approach. We first need to identify the pure literals (which appear with only one polarity in all the clauses) and unit clauses (single literal clauses).

Going through all the clauses, no pure literal or unit clause is found.

But let's look closely at the entire set of clauses; we can find that the clauses `(1 2 -4 0)` and `(-4 -5 2 0)` are repeated. We can eliminate the redundancy, but this won't help solve this problem as no solution exists.

Therefore, this problem contains no satisfiable valuations for the literals that would make every clause true.

Answer: UNSATISFIABLE
