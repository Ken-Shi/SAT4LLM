This problem is written in DIMACS format which is an encoding format for boolean satisfiability problems (SAT), a classic problem in computer science and artificial intelligence. The goal is to determine if it is possible to assign True or False to each variable in such a way that all clauses (lines) are satisfied.

This particular instance consists of 5 variables (as stated by the line "p cnf 5 22") and 22 clauses (each line ending in 0).

The approach to solve this problem is to use an algorithm for solving SAT problems. The simplest algorithm is a naive search, but more advanced algorithms like the DPLL algorithm or conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) algorithms are typically used in practice. 

The details of the algorithm are complex, but generally involve choosing a variable and a value for it, simplifying the problem under this assumption, and then recursively solving the simpler problem. If a contradiction is reached, the algorithm backtracks and tries a different assignment.

Here, I will solve the problem using a simplified version of the DPLL algorithm:

1. Pick an unassigned variable and determine whether the SAT problem is satisfiable when this variable is set to True. If not, try False. If neither value leads to a satisfiable problem, conclude that the original problem was not satisfiable.

2. Once a variable has been set, remove all clauses that are now satisfied and simplify remaining clauses, if possible. If a clause is falsified, backtrack to the last assigned variable and try a different assignment.

3. Continue this process until all variables are assigned and all clauses are satisfied.

4. Record the sequence of variable assignments that led to a solution, and output this sequence as the solution.

By following this method, we find out that the assignments 

1=-1, 2=-1, 3=1, 4=1, 5=1 

satisfy all clauses which means the original SAT problem is satisfiable with these assignments.

Answer: 1=-1,2=-1,3=1,4=1,5=1
