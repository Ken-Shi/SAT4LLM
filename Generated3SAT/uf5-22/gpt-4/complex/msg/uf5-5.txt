This problem is a boolean satisfiability problem. We would be solving this problem using the DPLL (a specific type of backtracking) algorithm.

The DPLL algorithm mainly consists of three heuristics:

1. Unit propagation: This is the simplest heuristic and forces a value to be true if it is the only unassigned variable in a clause.
2. Pure literal elimination: If a variable occurs with same polarity in all clauses, it is assigned the value that makes all the clauses true.
3. Learning: If a variable is causing conflict, it is assigned the opposite value.

Let's begin our process by searching for pure literals and unit clauses, but we see none.

Since we do not have any unit clause or pure literals, we will have to choose a literal. We'll start with first literal 5(shown as -5 in first clause) (but this is not necessary; we could start with any literal). 

We'll make two recursive calls with literal 5 set to truthy and falsy respectively. On careful observation, when setting 5 to false, we immediately see contradictions (unit clauses containing -5 and 5). Thus, it is obvious the path of setting 5 to true must be correct. 

With this choice, the clauses which include positive 5 get satisfied and removed. And in the clauses with negative 5, 5 gets removed. 

Upon simplifying, we get:

1 -2 0 
-2 -4 0
-4 3 2 0
-3 -2 0
-4 -2 0
3 -1 0
1 4 0
-2 1 0
-2 1 0
3 -4 0
1 -4 0
4 -2 0
3 1 0
3 -4 2 0
-4 1 -2 0
-4 1 0
3 -1 -4 0
-4 1 0
-2 4 0
3 4 0

We continue with the same process, selecting the first literal which is 1. We make two recursive calls with literal 1 set to truthy and falsy respectively. Again, setting 1 to false leads to contradiction. So, we set it to true. 

This simplification leads to:

-2 0
-4 3 2 0
-3 -2 0
-4 -2 0
-4 0
4 -2 0
3 0
-4 2 0
3 -4 0
4 -2 0
-4 2 0
3 -4 0
-4 2 0
-2 4 0
3 4 0

Continuing this process with literals -2, -4, 3, we find that the only solution that doesn't lead to contradiction is when all these literals are to set to true.

So, all the literals being considered were to set to true.

Answer: {5: true, 1: true, -2: true, -4: true, 3: true}
