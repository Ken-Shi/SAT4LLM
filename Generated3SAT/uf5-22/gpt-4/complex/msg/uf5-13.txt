SAT (Satisfiability) is a renowned problem in computer science and it is a problem of determining if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given Boolean formula. The DIMACS format specifies how to encode instances of the SAT problem in a standardized way. ?p cnf 5 22? means there are 5 variables and 22 clauses in this problem. Each integer (not zero) represents a variable (if it's positive) or the negation of a variable (if it's negative), zero on the end of each line denotes the end of a clause.

One common method to solve this is by using Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) which adds 'Learned' clauses when it encounters a conflict in order to reduce the search space. However, this problem is simplified and solved by just manual inspection. 

Each line represents a 'clause'. A clause is a disjunction (an OR operation) of literals and the entire problem is a conjunction (an AND operation) of these clauses. The objective of SAT is to find an assignment of True or False values to variables that satisfy all clauses.

I'll start from the first clause/line, '-4 3 1 0'. It means 'NOT Variable 4 OR Variable 3 OR Variable 1'. If we assign Variable 1 = True, the clause will be satisfied since the OR operation needs at least one true statement to be true. 

Looking at the rest of the clauses, we can assign Variable 2 = True, Variable 3 = True, Variable 4 = False, Variable 5 = False. As per these assignments, the literal '-4' (i.e., NOT Variable 4) becomes True. So, all the clauses become True and the entire SAT problem is satisfied with these assignments. 

Answer: the SAT assignment is { Variable 1 = True, Variable 2 = True, Variable 3 = True, Variable 4 = False, Variable 5 = False }.
