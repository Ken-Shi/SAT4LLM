This is an instance of the boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), where the goal is to find an assignment of truth values (True or False) to a set of boolean variables that satisfies a certain set of clauses. Each clause is a disjunction (OR) of one or several variables or their negations, and the complete problem is a conjunction (AND) of all clauses.

In this specific problem, we have 5 variables numbered from 1 to 5, and 22 clauses spread across 22 lines. Each line contains a clause followed by zero (0), which denotes the end of the clause. The number at the start of each line is a variable. If the number is positive, it means the variable itself, if it is negative, it means the negation of variable. The clause is satisfied if at least one of its variables is True under our assignment, and the problem is satisfied if all clauses are satisfied.

One solution can be found by a systematic search of all possible assignments, but we can often speed this up by using the structure of the problem. For instance, if a variable appears in positive form in one clause and in negative form in another, we can try assigning it true first, which would satisfy the first clause, and then modify the second clause.

Let's try to see if there's a direct solution: negate clauses that contain negative variables and try to arrange the system so all clauses are satisfied.

For example, clause 1: "-2 -3 1 0" can be negated and gives us "2, 3, -1". If we look through the clauses we see that there is no contradiction to variable 2 being true and variable 3 being true. However, variable 1 being false contradicts with several clauses. Thus, the only solution is to not negate clause 1. Therefore, variable 2 is false, variable 3 is false, and variable 1 is true.

By following this logic and working through each clause, an assignment of values that satisfies all the clauses is as follows:

Answer: 1=true, 2=false, 3=false, 4=true, 5=true.
