The SAT (satisfiability) problem is a decision problem which asks whether there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given Boolean formula, or in other words, whether the variables of a given Boolean formula can be consistently replaced by the values TRUE or FALSE in such a way that the formula evaluates to TRUE.

The DIMACS format provided is a standard format for specifying instances of the SAT problem. The first line specifies that there are 5 variables (hence the '5') and 22 clauses (hence the '22'). The following lines contain the 22 clauses of the formula. Each clause is a disjunction of literals (either a variable or its negation) and ends with a '0'.

To solve the problem, we need to find a truth assignment for the variables that makes all the clauses true. This can be done using a SAT solver, but it can also be done manually by reasoning through the problem. 

Looking at the clauses, you can see that certain variables appear only in negative form (like -5), and others appear both in positive and negative form (like 1, 2, 3, 4). Any variable that only appears in positive or negative form can be directly assigned a value: for variables that only appear in negative form, the value is false (because if it was true, there would be a conflict); and for variables that only appear in positive form, the value is true.

Assigning such values can simplify the problem and allow us to make more assignments. As we assign values to variables, any clause that involves a variable that has been assigned a truth value that makes the clause true can be deleted, because this clause is already satisfied by our current assignment and its other literals are now irrelevant. This process can be repeated until all variables have assigned values and all the clauses are satisfied.

For the provided DIMACS, variables 5 appears only as -5, thus we assign false to it. 

While variable 1 appears both as negative and positive, looking at the arities where 1 appears as positive: 
-4 -2 1 0 and -4 5 -1 0 

It is clear that the corresponding literals -4 and -2 , and -4 and 5 are both already appeased by assigning false to all 4 of them as well. Thus variable 1 can also assigned true without resulting in any conflict.   
 

Having made these assignments, it's left with 2, 3, and 4 which appear both in positive and negative. Picking an arbitrary assignment for one of this variable and following the reasoning chain can lead us to assigning the remaining two variables.

Testing variable 2 as true (and thus -2 as false):
first clause -3 -2 -4 0 is already true,
second clause -3 -1 2 0 becomes -3 true,
then clause -3 -4 2 0 is already true,
and so is clause -3 -4 -2 0 ,
and clause 2 -3 -5 0 becomes -3 and thus -3 is false,
which leads to clause -3 -1 -2 0 and -3 -1 2 0 becomes true,
and testing clause 2 -3 -4 0 leads to -4,
and so clause -2 4 -3 0 becomes 4.
eventually all clauses become true.

Note that the steps above does not always guarantee finding a solution, as the choice of which variable to pick and the truth value is arbitrary, finding a falsifying clause and backtracking to a previous assignment and flipping the truth value (a case of 2-SAT) can sometimes be required. Fortunately in this case it wasn't required.

We now have a valid assignment where all clauses (or equivalently, the whole formula) are satisfied, giving us the final solution.

Answer: 

1 = True
2 = True
3 = False
4 = False
5 = False
