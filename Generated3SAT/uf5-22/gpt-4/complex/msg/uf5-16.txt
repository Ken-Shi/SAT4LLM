The problem presented is a SAT (boolean satisfiability) problem, which is essentially a question of whether there exists a valid assignment of boolean values to certain variables that makes a logical expression true.

In your question, the DIMACS format allows us to see all the clauses in their conjunctive normal form (CNF). Every line after ?p cnf 5 22? outlines a clause that must be true, with each integer representing a variable (or its negation if the integer is negative). A '0' represents end of a clause.

Here is one way to approach the problem:

1. We first simplify the problem by removing duplicates,'reduntant clauses', looking for singletons i.e., unit clauses, or performing boolean resolution.

2. But, this problem is a simple one and can be initialized by testing it out methodologically.

3. We first evaluate clause by clause by giving variables boolean values(positive variables take true if they make clause true, and vice versa). For example, the first clause is (4 1 -3).  This clause will be true if 4 is true, 1 is true, or -3 (which is equivalent to not 3) is true. first we assign 4 and 1 to True and 3 to false.

4. This must be true for all clauses If it fails anywhere we choose next assignment for the failed clause and continue.

5. Since this is exhaustive, we might find a SAT assignment in the worst case we have to evaluate all assignments.

Due to complexity, such problems are evaluated through satisfiability solvers. But this can be done manually if the problem isn't too complex. Here is one of the possible solutions after following the steps.

Answer: 1=True, 2=True, 3=False, 4=True, 5=True
