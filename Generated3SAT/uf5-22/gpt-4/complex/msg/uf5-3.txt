Here are the procedural steps to solve the SAT problem.

1. The DIMACS file represents a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF). Each line of the file (except for the header) represents a clause of the formula. In a clause, each number except the last zero represents a literal. In the literal, positive integers represent the variables themselves and negative integers represent the negations of the variables. The variable number is the absolute value of the integer.

2. To find a satisfying assignment, we aim to assign a Boolean value (true or false) to each variable such that every clause has at least one true literal and hence the whole formula becomes true.

Know that:

   - A clause is true if any of its literals is true.
   - A literal is true if its variable is true and it's positive, or its variable is false and it's negative.

3. In some cases, the problem can be solved using the "unit clause" and "pure literal" rules:

   - A unit clause is a clause with only one unassigned variable. We must assign its variable to make the clause true.
   - A pure literal is a variable that appears with only one polarity in all clauses. We can assign it to make all these literals true.

However, in this case there are no unit clauses or pure literals that will help directly. We need to make decisions and try assignments.

4. We'll use a method called "branching" to make decisions and "backtracking" to revise wrong decisions.

Let's go:

- Assign 1 to true. This makes clauses [-5 -1 -3 0] and [-5 -1 4 0] true, so they're satisfied and should be removed from the formula. Now the third clause has only [-5 -2 0], which is a unit clause. Assign 2 to false to satisfy it.
- Assign 3 to true. This will satisfy several clauses, so we remove them from the formula. There is a unit clause [5], so assign 5 to true as well.
- Assign 4 to true. This satisfies the remaining clauses, so our assignment is a solution.

So, the solution to the SAT problem encoded in the DIMACS file is:

answer: 1=true, 2=false, 3=true, 4=true, 5=true
