                "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the method of iterative unit propagation.\n\nUnit propagation is a simple form of forward chaining that complements the rule of resolution in the DPLL algorithm used for solving the satisfiability of propositional logic. \n\nAt beginning, the solution list is NULL and looking at the clauses, there is no unit clause. So, we just pick an arbitrary literal say 1. If 1 is true, then -1 is false. We go through all clauses and if we see 1, we ignore that clause and if we see -1, we remove it. Similarly, if a clause contains both 1 and -1, that clause can be ignored as one of them will definitely be true making that clause true. \n\nDoing such operation for all variables until all clauses are satisfied or no more unit clauses exist that can be propagated. \n\nNote: For larger problem sizes, we use solvers.\n\nFinal Answer:\n1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1"
