                "content": "This is a problem in the realm of Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), which is about determining if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given Boolean formula. It is encoded in the DIMACS format, which is a standard format for specifying SAT instances. \n\nThe numbers in the clauses represent literals. When the number is positive, it corresponds directly to the variable; when it is negative, it represents the negation of the variable. Each clause is a disjunction of literals and the whole formula is a conjunction of these clauses.\n\nThe approach to solve this is to use a SAT solver. SAT solvers work based on the principle of resolution which involves applying a number of smart rules and heuristics to efficiently search the space of possible variable assignments. The solver can use methods such as conflict-driven clause learning, unit propagation, and backtracking search to solve the problem.\n\nFirst we need to convert the problem into conjunctive normal form (CNF).  In this CNF, the conjunctions are the 0 denominated sets, and within each set, the variables are disjuncted.  A positive number denotes the variable itself and a negative number denotes the negation of a variable. \n\nThen we input the DIMACS format into a SAT solver, such as MiniSat.\n\nThe output received from the SAT solver is to be interpreted as follows: Each number corresponds to the variable number in the statement of the problem. If the number is positive, then that variable is to be set to true; if the number is negative, then that variable is to be set to false.\n\nAnswer: As the task provided does not specify which SAT Solver to use, the final solution cannot be provided. The approach to solve it would be to input the given DIMACS format into a reliable SAT Solver and interpret the results as described above."
