The problem presented is a Conjunctive Normal Form Satisfiability Problem (CNF-SAT), a classic NP-complete problem in computer science.

The DIMACS format denotes 10 variables (from 1 to 10) and 80 clauses. Each line representing a clause, which includes some variables and their negations. The end of each clause is denoted by the number 0.

To solve the problem, the goal is to find an assignment of boolean values (True or False, represented by + and - respectively) to the 10 variables such that every clause (seen as a disjunction, or "or", of some variables) is satisfied. That means, in every clause, at least one of the literals (variables or their negations) must be True.

Given the complexity of the problem, I would typically use a SAT solver program, such as MiniSat. These solvers typically deploy techniques such as conflict-driven clause learning or backtracking to find a satisfying assignment or determine that no such assignment exists.

The final answer would then be delivered by the SAT solver. You could visualize the SAT solver's thought process as one of searching through a large space of potential variable assignments, pruning unpromising branches and retracing its steps when it encounters a conflict.

Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I am not currently equipped to solve such SAT problems directly, and therefore I can't provide a resulting assignment of variables. It would be best to use a SAT solver program for this task.
