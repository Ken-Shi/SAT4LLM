Solving a SAT problem involves finding an assignment of truth values to the variables such that each clause (a disjunction of literals, represented by integers in DIMACS format) is satisfied. If such assignment is not possible, the problem is unsaid to be unsatisfiable.

The numbers in the SAT problem represent the literals (variables), where a positive number represents the variable (for example, 1 represents variable x), and a negative number represents the negation of the variable (for example, -1 represents not x). Each line of numbers in the SAT problem represents a clause, and the problem is satisfied if every clause can be satisfied. A clause is satisfied if at least one of its literals is true. 

To solve this SAT problem, we can use a technique known as DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) or any more modern SAT solving technique that involves the principles of variable assignment, unit propagation, and backtracking. Given the size of the problem and the quantity of variables and clauses, this would be a task that usually involves a SAT solver algorithm implementing such techniques. 

The typical strategy behind these techniques is to find and assign values to variables that result in the most number of clauses being satisfied and as quickly as possible to eliminate the clauses that can potentially lead to contradictions.

Due to the complexity and combinatorial nature of this problem, it is not feasible or efficient to solve this by hand. The algorithmic solution typically involves recursive variable assignments and strategic backtracking upon conflict detection.

A pythonic implementation using available SAT solvers library like PySat, would be required here to automate this process and finding the most suitable assignment.

Unfortunately, without knowing the exact combination of such variables and without running a program, it's impossible to predict the correct assignment of truth values.
