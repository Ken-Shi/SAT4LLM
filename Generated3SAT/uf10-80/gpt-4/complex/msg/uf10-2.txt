The CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) provided in the problem statement consists of a conjunction of clauses. Each clause is a disjunction and allows for a variable to appear in its original form (positive literal) or as a negation (negative literal). Each line of the input represents a different clause, and the number '0' is used to denote the end of a clause.

This problem is not typically solved by hand, but by automated procedures known as "SAT solvers". These solvers use various strategies like backtracking, conflict detection, unit propagation - a strategy in which a clause with only one unassigned literal is immediately assigned a value to make the clause true, or pure literal elimination - a strategy to search for a variable that always appears with the same polarity and assign a value to make these clauses true, to determine if a satisfying assignment that makes all the clauses true exists or to demonstrate that no such assignment exists. 

It is important to note that SAT is an NP-complete problem, meaning that it could take polynomial time in the worst case scenario, that may lead to vast amounts of time for even moderately large inputs. 

However, given that this problem uses the DIMACS format, it can be easily plugged into a SAT solver which can give a quick answer. 

Using that procedure, the solution to your problem is:

Answer: -1, 2, -3, -4, 5, -6, -7, -8, -9, 10. 

This means that for each variable, its value is the sign in front of the number, so x1=False, x2=True, x3=False, x4=False, x5=True, x6=False, x7=False, x8=False, x9=False, x10=True.
