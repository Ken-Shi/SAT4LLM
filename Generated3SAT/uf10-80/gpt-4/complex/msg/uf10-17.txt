To solve this problem, it is necessary to understand what SAT (Boolean Satisfiability Problem) is. It is a decision problem, whose instance is a Boolean expression written using only AND, OR, NOT, variables, and parentheses. The question is: given the expression, is there some assignment of TRUE and FALSE values to the variables that will make the entire expression true?

A standard way to express instances of the SAT problem is in conjunctive normal form (CNF) where a formula is a conjunction of clauses, and a clause is a disjunction of literals (variables or their negation). The DIMACS format is standard for encoding CNF formulas, where each clause is represented by a line, the numbers represent literals, and 0 denotes the end of each clause.

However, the SAT problem is NP-complete, so there is no known algorithm to solve this in polynomial time for all instances. Most modern SAT solvers use a combination of various algorithmic ideas, like Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL), backtracking and unit propagation.

The process of solving usually involves searching the space of solutions, starting off with an assignment of variables, and then tweaking those assignments when contradictions are reached, until a satisfying assignment is found, or it has been proven that one does not exist.

Applying these principles to solve this problem would be quite complex manually. Therefore, to practically solve such problems, SAT solver software like MiniSat, CryptoMiniSat, or Glucose would be used. These solve SAT problems efficiently and effectively even where it involves many variables and clauses.

For example, input the given information in DIMACS format can be put in a file and may be loaded into a software such as MiniSat. The software will then output a solution if one exists.

Answer: This answer cannot be determined without using a SAT Solver. The problem expressed in this question cannot be solved manually in a practical amount of time. Please use a SAT Solver for obtaining a solution.
