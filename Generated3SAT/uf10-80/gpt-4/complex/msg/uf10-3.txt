This problem can be solved using a method of propositional logic called the "Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland" (DPLL) algorithm, often implemented by SAT solvers.

Here I am giving a high-level overview of how DPLL algorithm works:

First, you need to examine your clauses and check if there is an unit clause, i.e., a clause with only one literal. If there is, you simplify your problem by making that literal true.

If there isn't, it's time to make a guess. Actually, it's a bit better than a guess because you're going to employ a heuristic: Always choose the variable that appears the most number of times. Let's say that variable is x. You then move on with x being true. If you reach a contradiction, you backtrack and try with x being false.

Each time you make a guess, that's a level. When you have to backtrack, you go up a level.

What the DPLL algorithm is doing is basically a depth-first search of the tree where each node is a variable assignment, the children of a node are the assignments of the next variable, and a path to a leaf is a complete assignment. If you're doing it by hand, you'll probably want to make use of a tabular method to keep track of what level you're at and what variables you've assigned at that level.

With all of that being said, this manually solving of SAT Problem needs a lot of computational power and it's quite tedious to do by hand for larger problems. But theoretically, this would be the way to tackle it.

In practice if you wanted to solve the given SAT problem you would use a SAT solver like MiniSat. After passing the given problem to the SAT solver, you will get the solution or 'UNSAT' if the problem is unsatisfiable.

answer: For this problem, you would use a SAT solver like MiniSat, Z3, or CryptoMiniSat to get the solution.
