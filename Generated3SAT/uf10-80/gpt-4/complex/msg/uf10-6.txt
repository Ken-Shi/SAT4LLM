The problem presented here is written in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) in the DIMACS format. Each row represents a clause which is a disjunction of literals, and the entire problem is a conjunction of these clauses. The numbers denote variables, which can be either positive (true) or negative (false), and the goal is to assign true or false to each variable in a way that satisfies all clauses.

One approach to solve this problem is to use a SAT solver, which uses techniques such as: 

1. Unit propagation: If there's only one unassigned variable in a clause, it must take the value that makes the clause true. 

2. Pure literal elimination: If a variable appears with only one polarity in all clauses, we can assign it the value that satisfies all those clauses. 

3. Clause learning: If we reach a conflict (meaning we can't satisfy all clauses), we backtrack and learn a new clause that prevents us from making the same mistake. 

4. Variable and value selection: Heuristics are used to decide which variable to assign next, and what value to assign it.

Unfortunately, we can't always apply these techniques manually since they require a global view of clause-to-variable interactions and may involve a lot of backtracking (undoing decisions). In large CNF problems, as in this case, a computerized SAT solver is needed.

We can use a SAT solver such as 'MiniSat' to solve this problem. After loading our problem into 'MiniSat', it would perform the above-mentioned techniques, iterating until it either finds a solution that satisfies all clauses or proves that no such solution exists. 

Due to the complexity of these types of problems, it's not practical to solve them manually or to lay out the line of thoughts that the solver is 'thinking' through while solving.

The final answer would be a list of numbers. Each number would correspond to a variable from the original problem, with the sign of the number representing whether the variable is true (positive number) or false (negative number).

Note: I can't run a SAT solver in this environment to get the exact answer, but to answer this question we would need to run the problem in a SAT solver, which would quickly give the precise answer.
