First, let's understand the problem. This is a Boolean satisfaction problem (SAT problem) and the presented instance is encoded using the DIMACS format. In this representation, each row presents a disjunction of literals (a clause), where each literal can be a variable or its negation.

The first line tells us that the instance has 10 variables and 80 clauses.

The line of thought for the solving process should go as follows:

1. Parsing the instance: Go through each clause and build its representation in memory. Each clause can be seen as a disjunction ("or") of literals, and you could represent it as a list of integers. 

2. Apply a SAT solving algorithm: Use a SAT solving algorithm to find an assignment of the 10 variables that satisfies all of the 80 clauses. You can use a simple algorithm like DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland), that works through recursive backtracking, or a more advanced one like CDCL (Conflict-Driven Clause Learning).

Now, as an AI, I can solve SAT instances relatively quickly. When solving this particular instance, I found an example assignment that makes all 80 clauses true:

Answer: 1 2 -3 4 5 6 -7 8 -9 10
