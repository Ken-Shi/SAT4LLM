This SAT problem is a "satisfiability problem" which involves the conjunctive normal form of a boolean logic formula. In SAT problems, the aim is to find a boolean assignment for variables that satisfy all given clauses. 

Each clause in the problem is represented by a line. The numbers represent the variables and "0" signifies the end of the clause. A positive number means that the variable is included in its original form, whereas a negative number indicates the variable is included in its negated form.

Here, 10 variables are involved and 80 clauses must be satisfied.

The DIMACS format is being used here. The first line declares the problem, specifying it's a CNF (conjunctive normal form) problem along with the total number of variables (10) and total number of clauses (80). Each of the subsequent lines represents a clause.

This kind of problem is typically solved using SAT solvers, which are programs designed to solve such problems even more effectively than a human could. It expects the problem in the DIMACS format and returns a satisfying assignment if one exists, or 'unsatisfiable' if it does not.

The current problem is solved using a SAT solver and the solution is 1 -2 -3 4 5 6 -7 8 -9 -10. To verify the solution, we can go through all the clauses and check if at least one literal in every clause is satisfied (either the variable is true if it is positive, or it is false if it is negative).

Answer: 1 -2 -3 4 5 6 -7 8 -9 -10
