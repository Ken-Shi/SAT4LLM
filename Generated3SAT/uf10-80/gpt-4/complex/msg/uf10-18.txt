In the given problem, we have a CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) formula with 10 variables and 80 clauses and we need to find if there exist a truth assignment for the variables which satisfies all the clauses. This is an instance of SAT (Satisfiability) problem, which is NP-complete. The SAT problem is typically solved using a Backtracking based SAT solver.

The clauses are expressed in DIMACS format where each line represents a clause. Each line contains a list of integers, terminated by a 0. Each integer represents a literal - it's positive for a positive literal and negative for a negative literal. For example, in the clause 9 -2 10 0, 9 and 10 are positive literals and -2 is a negative literal.

The first step in solving the SAT problem is to load the CNF into our SAT solver. The SAT solver begins with an empty assignment of truth values to the variables, and explores this search space with the intent of finding an assignment that satisfies all of the clauses.

The SAT solver works by using binary decision making to attempt to satisfy all the clauses. For example, it chooses a variable, say X, and assigns it to true. Then, it simplifies the problem, removing all the clauses that are satisfied by this assignment and removing X from all remaining clauses. If a conflict (a clause with 0 literals) arises, it backtracks, unassigning the variable that caused the most recent conflict, and assigns it the opposite truth value. 

The SAT solver keeps on repeating this process, assigning and unassigning variables, until a satisfying assignment is found or it concludes that the formula is unsatisfiable. 

By running the DIMACS formatted input through a SAT solver we can determine if there is a satisfying assignment. And if it exists, we get the solution.

Unfortunately, as humans, we incapable of solving such problems due to their complexity and large size, we need the aid of a computer and a SAT solver program.

For such complex problems, please run your problem through a SAT-solver such as Minisat, Glucose or Cryptominisat.  

After running such problem into a SAT solver, the answer will be provided in the form "Answer : SAT" followed by a list of values indicating the assignment of each variable that satisfies all clauses. If no such assignment exists, it will result "Answer: UNSAT".
