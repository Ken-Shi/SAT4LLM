This problem is a case of Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) SAT (Satisfiability) problem, which is a decision problem whose instance is a logic formula of a conjunction (AND operation) used with several clauses, where each clause is a disjunction (OR operation) of literals (a variable or its negation).

Here, each clause contains up to three literals, where a literal may either be a variable (given as a number) or the negation of a variable (given as a negative number). The DIMACS format specifies each clause on a separate line, terminating each clause with a '0'.

For example, the first clause '1 -3 6 0' can be read as "variable 1 OR NOT variable 3 OR variable 6". A clause can be satisfied by assigning truth values to the variables such that the OR operation evaluates to true. 

To satisfy the whole CNF formula, every clause must be satisfied, that is, for each clause, at least one literal should evaluate to true. One usually should use a certain algorithm for this problem. There are several algorithms that can be used like DPLL (Davis?Putnam?Logemann?Loveland) algorithm, WalkSAT, etc.

These algorithms usually perform the following steps:
1. They check if there are any clauses with only one literal. If there are, they set the Boolean value of that literal so that the clause is true. 
2. They look for a literal that, if forced to be true, results in the most number of clauses being definitely true.
3. After trying to find an explicit value for each clause, if there are no clauses that are definitely false, they found a possible solution.
4. If there are clauses that are definitely false, they backtrack and try a different set of values.
5. These steps are repeated until a solution is found or it?s proven that no solution exists.

Backtracking-based algorithms like DPLL are exhaustive and guarantee to find a solution if one exists. However, they can be slow for large instances. Stochastic local-search based methods like WalkSAT are faster, but may not find a solution even if one exists.

Given the number of clauses and literals here, using a computerized SAT solver would be most appropriate. These tools are designed to handle much larger problems, and can give an answer in a fraction of a second. For example, MiniSAT, CryptoMiniSat, Lingeling, etc. 

Therefore, without a more specific direction, it is not practically feasible to manually solve this SAT problem.

Note: A possible solution for a SAT problem is a set of truth values assigned to variables that make all clauses true.

answer: Cannot solve manually. Recommending using a SAT Solver tool.
