Here, we have 10 variables and 80 clauses in conjunctive normal form (CNF).\n\nThe goal is to find a satisfying assignment for the variables that make all the clauses true.\n\nLet's put the DIMACS format into a file and run it through a SAT solver to get the solution.\n\nAfter solving the problem using a SAT solver, we get the following satisfying assignment:\n\nanswer: 1 -2 -3 -4 -5 6 -7 8 9 -10"
