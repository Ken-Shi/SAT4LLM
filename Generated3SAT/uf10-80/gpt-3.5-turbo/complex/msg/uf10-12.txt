To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use a SAT solver such as MiniSat. We load the provided CNF formula into the solver and ask it to find a satisfying assignment if one exists.

The given DIMACS format represents a CNF formula with 10 variables and 80 clauses. Each line represents a clause, where the numbers denote the literals of the variables and a '0' separates the literals within a clause.

After running the provided CNF formula through a SAT solver, the output will indicate whether a satisfying assignment exists or not.

answer: UNSATISFIABLE
