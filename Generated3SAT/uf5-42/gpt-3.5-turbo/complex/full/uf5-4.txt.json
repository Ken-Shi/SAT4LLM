We need to satisfy as many clauses as possible to find a solution.\n\nLet's try to reason through it:\n\n- Start with clause 1: 4 -5 3. Assume variable 4 is true.\n- From clause 5: -5 3 -2. Since we assumed 4 to be true, set -5 to be true. \n- From clause 11: -5 4 -1. Since -5 is true, set 4 to be false.\n- From clause 23: 3 5 -4. Set 3 and 5 to be true.\n- From clause 15: 3 -2 -4. Set 2 to be false.\n- From clause 16: -4 -2 -1. Set 1 to be false.\n- From clause 18: -1 4 -3. Set 3 to be false.\n- From clause 24: 3 4 2. Set 2 to be true.\n- From clause 26: 4 3 2. Already satisfied.\n\nTherefore, a satisfying assignment is: \n1 = False\n2 = True\n3 = True\n4 = False\n5 = True\n\nanswer: 2 -3 5"
