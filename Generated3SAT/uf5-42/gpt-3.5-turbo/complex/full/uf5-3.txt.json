Let's say we assign 4 as true.\n\nThen looking at other clauses, we can work our way through and try various assignments to the variables, evaluating each clause until we find a satisfying assignment to all clauses.\n\nAfter going through all the clauses and testing different assignments, we find that the following assignment satisfies all clauses:\n\nanswer: 1 -2 3 4 -5"
