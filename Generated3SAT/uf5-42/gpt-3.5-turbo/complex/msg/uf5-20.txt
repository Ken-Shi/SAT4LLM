To solve this SAT problem, we first need to understand the DIMACS format. The problem is defined with 5 variables and 42 clauses. Each line represents a clause, with a 0 at the end to indicate the end of the clause. Positive integers represent variables, while negative integers represent the negation of variables.

Next, we need to apply the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm or any other SAT-solving algorithm to find a satisfying assignment. Here are the steps of the algorithm:

1. Start with an empty assignment.

2. Check each clause to see if there is a unit clause or a pure literal assignment. If found, update the assignment accordingly.

3. If there are no unit clauses or pure literals, choose a variable (heuristic selection) and assign it a truth value (can be either true or false).

4. Check each clause to simplify the formula with the chosen assignment. Remove clauses that are satisfied and simplify the remaining clauses.

5. Recursively call the algorithm with the updated assignment until all clauses are satisfied (empty).

Now, let's apply the DPLL algorithm to solve this SAT problem. I will now determine the satisfying assignment.

Answer: This SAT problem is satisfiable. A possible satisfying assignment is:
1. True
2. True
3. True
4. False
5. True

Answer: 1 1 1 -1 1
