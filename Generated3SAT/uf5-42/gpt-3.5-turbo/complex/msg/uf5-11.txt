To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to find a satisfying assignment that makes all the clauses true.

The DIMACS format given states that there are 5 variables and 42 clauses.

Let's create a truth table to check all possible combinations of values for the 5 variables (1=true, 0=false):

1  2  3  4  5
---------------------
T  T  T  T  T
T  T  T  T  F
...

We will loop through all the clauses to determine if they are all satisfiable with any of the truth table rows.

After checking all the clauses with the truth table, we find that the following assignment makes all the clauses true:
