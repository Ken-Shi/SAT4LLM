This SAT problem is encoded in DIMACS format, with 5 variables and 42 clauses.

To solve this problem, we need to find a truth assignment to the variables (either true or false) that satisfies all the clauses. 

Starting from the first clause, we see that we have:
4 5 2, which means at least one of these must be true. Let's say we assign 4 as true.

Then looking at other clauses, we can work our way through and try various assignments to the variables, evaluating each clause until we find a satisfying assignment to all clauses.

After going through all the clauses and testing different assignments, we find that the following assignment satisfies all clauses:

answer: 1 -2 3 4 -5
