To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will apply the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. 

We are given 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and 42 clauses. 

Let's start by assigning truth values to the variables and evaluating each clause based on these assignments:

1. If a clause contains a variable and its negation, the clause is unsatisfiable.
2. If a clause contains a variable that is true, the clause is satisfied.
3. If a clause does not contain any variable, the clause is satisfied.

We will now proceed with the DPLL algorithm to determine the solution to the problem.

Initially, we randomly assign truth values to the variables and start evaluating the clauses one by one.

After going through all the clauses multiple times to assign truth values to variables accordingly:

answer: UNSATISFIABLE
