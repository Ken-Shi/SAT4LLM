So starting from top of list, we will set\n1 = false, 2 = true, 3 = false, 4 = true, 5 = false based on -1, 2, -3, 4, -5 in the first statement.\n\nStep 2: Move down the list and apply unit propagation. We will find contradictions and apply backjumping to find assignments that satisfy the conditions.\n\nGoing through the list, the first Contradiction is at line \"5 4 -3 0\" as 5 = false, 4 = true, -3 = true. At this conflict, try backjumping to change 5 to true. This does not cause any other conflicts in previous statements and 5= true.\n\nContinue to propagate the unit throughout and encounter Contradiction at line \"-5 2 3 0\" because -5 = false, 2 = true, 3 = false where we have previously set 5 = true. At this conflict, backjump to statement \"-5 -1 -3 0\" where we initially set 5 = false. Change parameter 3 = true.\n\nContinue to propagate the unit throughout and encounter Contradiction at line \"3 -5 1 0\" because 3 = false, -5 = false, 1 = true where we have previously set 3 = true. Back jump to \"-3 -5 4 0\" where we initially set 3 and 5 = false. Change parameter 1 = true.\n\nAt this point of time, we have assignments as  1 = true, 2 = true, 3 = true, 4 = true, and 5 = true.\n\nStep 3: There are no contradictions after applying new assignments, which indicates that a solution has been found. \n\nAnswer: 1 = true, 2 = true, 3 = true, 4 = true 5 = true.
