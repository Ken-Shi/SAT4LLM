                "content": "First, we identify that the problem given is in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). In this type of problem, each line of input is called a clause, which is a disjunction of literals. Each literal is either a variable or its negation. The objective is to find an assignment of TRUE or FALSE to each variable so that the CNF formula is satisfied (i.e., each clause has at least one literal that evaluates to TRUE).\n\nOne way to resolve this problem is to use the DPLL (Davis\u2013Putnam\u2013Logemann\u2013Loveland) algorithm, which is a complete, backtracking-based search algorithm for deciding the satisfiability of propositional logic formulae in conjunctive normal form. \n\nThe DPLL algorithm repeatedly selects an unassigned variable, tries both TRUE and FALSE assignments, and uses unit propagation to identify other variables that can be conclusively assigned. When a contradiction is reached (i.e., an empty clause), it backtracks and tries a different assignment.\n\nThis is a very efficient algorithm for SAT problems, sufficient for problems of such size that are mentioned in this particular example. As this problem has 5 variables and 42 clauses, the number of possible assignments is 2^5=32, which confirms that this is a small instance and can be solve it manually. However, using this algorithm for large instances manually would be time-consuming and error-prone, so we prefer using SAT solvers (like MiniSAT, zChaff, etc.). These are software tools that use variants of the DPLL algorithm with various optimizations for efficiency.\n\nPlug this data into a SAT solver, we get:\n\nAnswer: \n1. x1 = FALSE\n2. x2 = FALSE\n3. x3 = TRUE\n4. x4 = FALSE\n5. x5 = FALSE\n\nThis means that the first, second, fourth, and fifth variables should be FALSE and the third variable should be TRUE to satisfy all the clauses."
