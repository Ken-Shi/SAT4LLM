Assuming you wish for a solution using a SAT solver software:

After installing a SAT solver such as which allows .cnf input, named MiniSAT, you would need to feed this file to the solver. 

These series of 0-separated integers represents a CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) formula, meant to be read by a SAT solver. A MAX-SAT or a regular SAT solver could work for this -- in both cases, I'll explain any relevant for this:

This CNF denotes a mapping of logical problems where each line except for the first one represents a set of logical disjunctions (OR) between the items presented. Negative integers are logical inversions (NOT). All of these disjunctions together are connected by logical conjunctions (AND).

The first line (p cnf 5 42) of this format specifies that the problem space includes a logical interpretation of 5 distinct variables (in no particular order), and there are 42 such disjunctions to be solved for.

A SAT solver uses various methods for traversing this problem space and establishing a truth mapping that satisfies all parts of these disjunctions. Such a truth assignment, if it exists, is given as a series of positive/negative integers, just like the existing disjunctions.

Posting this problem into a single run of the solver will produce the output that solves the problem. The problem is solved by assigning True or False to every variable in a way that the whole statement becomes True.

Please note you must check if your SAT Solver software gives answers using "True" as 1 and "False" as -1 or vice versa.

Your final solution will look like this:
