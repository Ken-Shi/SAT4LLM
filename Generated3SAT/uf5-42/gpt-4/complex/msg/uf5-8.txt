In order to solve this SAT problem, one can use a SAT solver tool, such as MiniSat, CryptoMiniSat, Glucose, etc. 

Here's a general guide on how the process is:

First, one can transform the given set of clauses into an implication graph. The implications are derived from the clauses like:
if -4 & 3 & -2 = true, then (4 = false, or 3 = true, or 2 = false) must be true.
These graphs are used to track the reasoning that would lead to a contradiction if one exists.

During this graphing process, one repeatedly applies Boolean constraint propagation (BCP). If there is only a single literal in a clause, or all but one of the literals in a clause has been set to false, then the remaining literal must be set to make the clause true.

If there are no unit clauses left and we haven?t found a conflict yet, it means we have to make another decision and add another layer to the decision level. We randomly pick a variable that has yet not been assigned a value, and assign it one.

This is combined with the conflicted driven clause learning. When there's a clash, we trace back to the decision that lead to the clash and add a new rule that prevents this specific mistake from happening again.

This process is continuously repeated until a valid assignment is found that satisfies all clauses or it has been proven that no such assignment exists.

Let's solve the SAT problem using a SAT solver:
The efficient solvers use various optimization algorithms to solve faster than naive brute-force.

MINISAT is an example of such efficient algorithm and can be used to solve SAT problems including the given problem. Solvers like these can handle thousands of variables and millions of clauses.

MINISAT generates specific solutions which might look like 1 -2 3 4 -5.

Answer: As this is an automated process and heavily depends on the algorithm being used, it's not possible to provide a specific solution without using a tool or a software. Please use a SAT solver such as MiniSat to find the solution.
