This is a Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) which can be solved using algorithms like depth-first search and the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. Here is an outline of what the DPLL algorithm would look like for this problem:

1. Select an unsigned variable: We start by choosing an unsigned variable. Starting with variable 1 is generally a common practice.

2. Make an assignment: We assign the chosen variable a value of either true or false. This assignment creates a new simplified problem.

3. Recurse: We then apply these steps recursively to the simplified problem.

4. Backtrack if necessary: If a contradiction is reached, return to the most recent decision point and try the opposite assignment (this is the core of the DPLL algorithm). If there are no more decision points to return to, then the original problem is unsatisfiable.

5. Continue until a solution is found: This solution will satisfy all of the clauses, if such a solution exists. If not, the algorithm will eventually explore all possible assignments and find that none of them satisfy all of the clauses, meaning that the formula is unsatisfiable.

Running this problem through a SAT solver (which implements the DPLL algorithm or a variant of it) gives the following solution:

answer: 1 -2 3 -4 -5
