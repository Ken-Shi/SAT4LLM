(2 OR 3 OR -1)\n2. (3 OR -1 OR 2)\n\nTo solve this problem, we can try assigning truth values to the variables and check if the clauses are satisfied.\n\nLet's start with the first clause:\n1. (2 OR 3 OR -1)\n- If we assign True to variable 2, True to variable 3, and False to variable 1, the clause is satisfied.\n- The first clause is satisfied.\n\nNow, let's move on to the second clause:\n2. (3 OR -1 OR 2)\n- If we assign True to variable 3, False to variable 1, and True to variable 2, the clause is satisfied.\n- The second clause is satisfied.\n\nSince both clauses are satisfied, the solution is:\nanswer: 2 3 -1"
