The first line \"p cnf 3 2\" indicates that there are 3 variables and 2 clauses in the problem. \n\nThe clauses are:\n1. (2 \u2228 1 \u2228 3) = True if any of these literals are True, which means either variable 2, 1, or 3 must be True.\n2. (2 \u2228 \u00ac3 \u2228 1) = True if any of these literals are True, which means either variable 2, 1, or \u00ac3 must be True.\n\nNow, let's try all possible combinations of the variables to satisfy the clauses:\n\n1. If we set variable 2 to be True, then the first clause is satisfied.\n2. If we set variable 1 to be True, then the first clause is also satisfied.\n3. If we set variable 3 to be True, then both clauses are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the solution that satisfies both clauses is:\n- Variable 2 = True\n- Variable 1 = True\n- Variable 3 = True\n\nTherefore, \n\nanswer: 2 1 3"
