The variables are numbered from 1 to 3. \n\nThe next two lines are the clauses:\n1. -3 2 1 0\n2. 2 -3 -1 0\n\nFrom clause 1, we can see:\n- not variable 3 (negation of 3)\n- variable 2\n- variable 1\n\nFrom clause 2, we can see:\n- variable 2\n- not variable 3\n- not variable 1\n\nNow, let's try to satisfy these clauses:\n\n1. If we set variables 1, 2, and 3 to false (0, 0, 0), then clause 1 is satisfied because (-3, 2, 1) would all be true.\n   However, clause 2 is not satisfied because (2, -3, -1) would not all be true.\n\n2. If we set variables 1, 2, and 3 to true (1, 1, 1), then clause 1 is not satisfied because (-3) would be false.\n   Also, clause 2 is not satisfied because (-1) would be false.\n\nSince there is no assignment of truth values to the variables that satisfies both clauses, the problem is unsatisfiable.\n\nanswer: unsatisfiable"
