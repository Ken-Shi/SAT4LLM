The file consists of 3 variables and 2 clauses.\n\nThe clauses are:\nClause 1: 1 OR 2 OR NOT 3\nClause 2: 2 OR NOT 3 OR NOT 1\n\nBased on these clauses, we can see that for clause 1 to be true, either variable 1 or variable 2 must be true (since NOT 3 is included). For clause 2 to be true, variable 2 must be true (since NOT 3 is included) and either NOT 1 or NOT 3 must be true.\n\nFrom analyzing the clauses, we can see that variable 2 must be true to satisfy both clauses, and since variable 2 is not negated, it must be assigned a value of true. Assigning variable 2 = true satisfies both clauses.\n\nTherefore, the satisfying assignment for this SAT problem is:\n1. Variable 1 = false\n2. Variable 2 = true\n3. Variable 3 = false\n\nanswer: 2 true 1 false 3 false"
