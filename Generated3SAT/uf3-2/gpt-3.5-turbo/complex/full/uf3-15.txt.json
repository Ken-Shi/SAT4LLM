The first line \"p cnf 3 2\" indicates that there are 3 variables and 2 clauses in the problem. Each clause is represented on a separate line with the variables listed followed by a 0.\n\nThe clauses are as follows:\n1 2 -3 0\n3 -2 1 0\n\nNow, let's analyze the clauses one by one:\n\nClause 1: 1 2 -3\nThis clause has three literals: 1, 2, and -3. This means that at least one of these literals must be true for the clause to be satisfied. Since variable 1 and variable 2 are both in the clause, we can say that this clause is satisfied if either variable 1 or variable 2 is true.\n\nClause 2: 3 -2 1\nThis clause also has three literals: 3, -2, and 1. Similarly, this clause is satisfied if either variable 3 or variable 1 is true.\n\nNow, let's find the solution that satisfies both clauses:\n\n- If we set variable 1 = true, then clause 1 is satisfied. However, clause 2 cannot be satisfied with this assignment because variable 1 is true.\n- If we set variable 1 = false and variable 2 = true, then both clauses are satisfied. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nanswer: 1 false, 2 true, 3 true"
