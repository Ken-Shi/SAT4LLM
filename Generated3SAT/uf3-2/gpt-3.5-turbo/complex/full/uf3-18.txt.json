The first line \"p cnf 3 2\" indicates that there are 3 variables and 2 clauses in the problem.\n\nThe two clauses provided are:\n1. -3 -1 2 0\n2. -3 -2 -1 0\n\nNow, we need to find a solution that satisfies both clauses. Let's break down the clauses:\n\n1. -3 -1 2 0\nThis clause can be satisfied if variable 3 is False, variable 1 is False, and variable 2 is True.\n\n2. -3 -2 -1 0\nThis clause can be satisfied if variable 3 is False, variable 2 is False, and variable 1 is False.\n\nTherefore, a solution that satisfies both clauses is:\n- Variable 1 is False\n- Variable 2 is False\n- Variable 3 is False\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \nanswer: -1 -2 -3"
