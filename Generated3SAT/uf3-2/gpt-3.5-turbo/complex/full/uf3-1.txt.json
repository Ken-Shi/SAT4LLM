Let's analyze the clauses: \n\n1. If we let 1 be true, then the clause would be satisfied because \u00ac1 would be false. \n2. If we let 2 be true, then the clause would not be satisfied because \u00ac2 would be false, making the whole clause false. \n3. If we let 3 be true, then the clause would not be satisfied because \u00ac3 would be false, making the whole clause false. \n\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that variable 1 being true satisfies both clauses. \n\nTherefore, the solution to this SAT problem is: \nanswer: 1"
