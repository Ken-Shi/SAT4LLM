A' \u2228 B' \u2228 C\n2. B \u2228 C' \u2228 A'\n\nTo find a satisfying assignment for this problem, we can start by trying out different possibilities:\n\n1. If A = True, B = False, and C = False:\n   - The first clause becomes (False) \u2228 (True) \u2228 (False) = True\n   - The second clause becomes (False) \u2228 (True) \u2228 (True) = True\n   Both clauses are satisfied, so this assignment is valid.\n\n2. If A = False, B = True, and C = False:\n   - The first clause becomes (True) \u2228 (False) \u2228 (False) = True\n   - The second clause becomes (True) \u2228 (False) \u2228 (True) = True\n   Both clauses are satisfied, so this assignment is also valid.\n\n3. If A = False, B = False, and C = True:\n   - The first clause becomes (True) \u2228 (True) \u2228 (True) = True\n   - The second clause becomes (False) \u2228 (True) \u2228 (False) = True\n   Both clauses are satisfied, so this assignment is also valid.\n\nTherefore, there are multiple satisfying assignments for this problem.\n\nanswer: A=True, B=False, C=False. A=False, B=True, C=False. A=False, B=False, C=True."
