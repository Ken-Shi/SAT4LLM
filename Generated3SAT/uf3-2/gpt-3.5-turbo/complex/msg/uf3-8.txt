Line of thoughts:
- The problem is encoded in DIMACS format with 3 variables and 2 clauses.
- The first clause is (3 1 2 0), which means either variable 1 or variable 2 must be true along with variable 3.
- The second clause is (2 -1 -3 0), which means either variable 1 or variable 3 must be false along with variable 2.
- From the clauses, we can see that variable 3 must be true, and either variable 1 or variable 2 must also be true.
- Putting it all together, the solution is variable 3 is true, and either variable 1 or variable 2 is true.

answer: 3
