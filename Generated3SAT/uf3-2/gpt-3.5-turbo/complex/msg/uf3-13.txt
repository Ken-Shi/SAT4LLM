The given problem is encoded in DIMACS format as follows:
p cnf 3 2
1 3 2 0
-3 -1 2 0

This corresponds to a SAT problem with 3 variables and 2 clauses. The clauses are:
1. (1 OR 3 OR 2)
2. (-3 OR -1 OR 2)

To solve this problem, we can try to assign truth values to the variables in order to satisfy both clauses. Let's analyze each clause separately:

Clause 1: (1 OR 3 OR 2)
- If we assign True to variable 1, True to variable 2, and False to variable 3, then the clause is satisfied.
- If we assign False to variable 1, True to variable 2, and True to variable 3, then the clause is satisfied.

Clause 2: (-3 OR -1 OR 2)
- If we assign False to variable 1, True to variable 2, and False to variable 3, then the clause is satisfied.

Based on the above analysis, one possible solution to satisfy both clauses is:
Variable 1 = False
Variable 2 = True
Variable 3 = False

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: 010
