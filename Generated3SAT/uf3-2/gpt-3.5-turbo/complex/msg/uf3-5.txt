To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to interpret the clause statements:
1. (-1 OR 2 OR 3)
2. (-1 OR -2 OR -3)

Let's break down the clauses:
Clause 1: (-1 OR 2 OR 3)
- Since -1 is true (negated), the clause will be satisfied regardless of the truth values of 2 and 3.
- Therefore, any assignment of 2 and 3 will satisfy this clause.

Clause 2: (-1 OR -2 OR -3)
- Since -1 is true (negated), the clause will be satisfied regardless of the truth values of -2 and -3.
- Therefore, any assignment of -2 and -3 will satisfy this clause.

Putting both clauses together, we see that there is no possible assignment of variables that would satisfy both clauses simultaneously. This means that the problem is unsatisfiable.

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: UNSATISFIABLE
