To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will first note the following:
- The problem is in CNF format with 3 variables (1, 2, 3) and 2 clauses.
- The first clause is "-3 2 1 0", which means either variable 3 is false, or variable 2 is true, or variable 1 is true.
- The second clause is "-3 2 -1 0", which means either variable 3 is false, or variable 2 is true, or variable 1 is false.

Now, let's analyze the clauses:
- From the first clause, we can have the following combinations:
  1. -3 is true, 2 is false, 1 is false
  2. -3 is true, 2 is true, 1 is false
  3. -3 is false, 2 is true (the value of 1 does not matter in this case)

- From the second clause, we can have the following combinations:
  1. -3 is true, 2 is false, 1 is true
  2. -3 is true, 2 is true, 1 is false

Now we need to find a common solution that satisfies both clauses:
- Looking at the analysis above, we see that the only common solution is when:
  -3 is true, 2 is true, 1 is false

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: -3 2 -1
