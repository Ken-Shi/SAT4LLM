To solve this SAT problem, let's first break down the DIMACS format:

p cnf 3 2
-2 3 -1 0
3 -1 -2 0

- The first line "p cnf 3 2" indicates that there are 3 variables and 2 clauses.
- The second line "-2 3 -1 0" represents the first clause: (?x2 ? x3 ? ?x1)
- The third line "3 -1 -2 0" represents the second clause: (x3 ? ?x1 ? ?x2)

To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Begin with an assumption for each variable.
2. Substitute the assumptions into each clause and check if any clause evaluates to True.
3. If all clauses are satisfied, then the assumptions are the solution.

Let's check the clauses with the assumptions:

Assumption:
x1 = True
x2 = True
x3 = True

Clause 1: (?2 ? 3 ? ?1) = (?True ? True ? ?True) = (False ? True ? False) = True
Clause 2: (3 ? ?1 ? ?2) = (True ? ?True ? ?True) = (True ? False ? False) = True

Both clauses are satisfied with the assumptions x1=True, x2=True, x3=True. Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:

answer: x1=True, x2=True, x3=True
