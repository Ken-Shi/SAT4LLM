First, we need to understand the DIMACS format. The problem is in conjunctive normal form (CNF) and has 3 variables and 2 clauses.

The clauses are:
1. (2 OR 3 OR -1)
2. (3 OR -1 OR 2)

To solve this problem, we can try assigning truth values to the variables and check if the clauses are satisfied.

Let's start with the first clause:
1. (2 OR 3 OR -1)
- If we assign True to variable 2, True to variable 3, and False to variable 1, the clause is satisfied.
- The first clause is satisfied.

Now, let's move on to the second clause:
2. (3 OR -1 OR 2)
- If we assign True to variable 3, False to variable 1, and True to variable 2, the clause is satisfied.
- The second clause is satisfied.

Since both clauses are satisfied, the solution is:
answer: 2 3 -1
