To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to interpret the information provided. 

The first line "p cnf 3 2" tells us that there are 3 variables and 2 clauses in the problem. The variables are numbered from 1 to 3. 

The next two lines are the clauses:
1. -3 2 1 0
2. 2 -3 -1 0

From clause 1, we can see:
- not variable 3 (negation of 3)
- variable 2
- variable 1

From clause 2, we can see:
- variable 2
- not variable 3
- not variable 1

Now, let's try to satisfy these clauses:

1. If we set variables 1, 2, and 3 to false (0, 0, 0), then clause 1 is satisfied because (-3, 2, 1) would all be true.
   However, clause 2 is not satisfied because (2, -3, -1) would not all be true.

2. If we set variables 1, 2, and 3 to true (1, 1, 1), then clause 1 is not satisfied because (-3) would be false.
   Also, clause 2 is not satisfied because (-1) would be false.

Since there is no assignment of truth values to the variables that satisfies both clauses, the problem is unsatisfiable.

answer: unsatisfiable
