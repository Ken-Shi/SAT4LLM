To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, let's first denote the variables as follows:
1 -> A
2 -> B
3 -> C

The clauses given in DIMACS format are:
Clause 1: (-A or C or B)
Clause 2: (-A or B or C)

We need to find an assignment of truth values to these variables that satisfies both clauses.

Let's start by assigning truth values to variables:
A = False
B = False
C = False

Clause 1: (-False or False or False) is True
Clause 2: (-False or False or False) is True

Therefore, this assignment satisfies both clauses.

Answer: This SAT problem is satisfiable.
