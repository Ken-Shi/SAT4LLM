To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we first interpret the problem. The header "p cnf 3 2" indicates that there are 3 variables and 2 clauses in the problem. The two lines of clauses that follow encode the problem. Each number represents a variable, with negation indicated by a negative sign.

The problem can be represented as:
(-3 OR -2 OR -1) AND (-3 OR -2 OR 1)

To solve this problem, we can try to find a satisfying assignment for the variables that makes both clauses true. Let's examine the clauses one by one:

1. (-3 OR -2 OR -1): This clause is satisfied if at least one of the variables 3, 2, or 1 is True. Since all variables are negated, we can satisfy this by setting them to False.

2. (-3 OR -2 OR 1): This clause is satisfied if at least one of the variables 3, 2, or 1 is True. To satisfy this, we can set variable 1 to True.

Therefore, a satisfying assignment for the variables is:
3 = False
2 = False
1 = True

answer: 1 0 -2
