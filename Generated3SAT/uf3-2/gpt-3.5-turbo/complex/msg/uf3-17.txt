To solve this problem, we need to convert the DIMACS format into a logical expression. 

The first line "p cnf 3 2" tells us that there are 3 variables and 2 clauses. 
The second line "3 1 -2 0" represents the clause (3 OR 1 OR -2).
The third line "2 1 3 0" represents the clause (2 OR 1 OR 3).

Next, we need to examine each clause:

Clause 1: (3 OR 1 OR -2)
- If we assign variable 3 to True, variable 1 to True, and variable 2 to False, the clause becomes True. 
Clause 2: (2 OR 1 OR 3)
- If we assign variable 2 to True, variable 1 to True, and variable 3 to True, the clause becomes True. 

Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:
answer: 1 -2 3
