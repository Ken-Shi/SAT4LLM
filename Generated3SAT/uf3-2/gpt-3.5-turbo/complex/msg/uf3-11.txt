To solve this problem, we need to find a satisfying assignment that makes both clauses true.

The DIMACS format indicates that there are 3 variables (1, 2, and 3) and 2 clauses in the problem.

The first clause is "1 -2 3 0":
This can be translated to (1 OR NOT 2 OR 3).
For this clause to be satisfied, either variable 1 or 3 must be true. Variable 2 must be false.

The second clause is "1 3 -2 0":
This can be translated to (1 OR 3 OR NOT 2).
For this clause to be satisfied, either variable 1 or 3 must be true. Variable 2 must be false.

Thus, the solution to this SAT problem is:
answer: 1 0 -2 0 0
