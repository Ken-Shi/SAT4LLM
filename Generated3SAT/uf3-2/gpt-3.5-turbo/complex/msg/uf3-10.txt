To solve this SAT problem in DIMACS format, we need to first decode the problem:

- There are 3 variables (labeled 1, 2, and 3)
- There are 2 clauses:

1. ?2 ? 1 ? 3
2. 3 ? 1 ? ?2

Next, we will go through the clauses and see if we can find a solution:

1. If we set variable 2 to false (?2), then the first clause becomes true because ?2 is true. So, 1 and 3 can be either true or false. This satisfies the first clause.

2. If we set variable 3 to true (3), then the second clause becomes true because 3 is true. So, 1 and 2 can be either true or false. This satisfies the second clause.

Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:
- Variable 2 is false
- Variable 3 is true
- Variable 1 can be either true or false

answer: 2 false 3 true
