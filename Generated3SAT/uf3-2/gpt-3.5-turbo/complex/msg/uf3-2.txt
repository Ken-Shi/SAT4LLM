To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, let's first interpret the problem. The problem has 3 variables and 2 clauses.

The clauses given are:
1. (3 or 1 or -2) 
2. (3 or -1 or 2)

To solve the problem, we can simply find a truth assignment that satisfies both clauses:

For the first clause: 
- If we set variable 1 to be true, variable 2 to be false, and variable 3 to be true, the clause becomes true. 

For the second clause:
- If we set variable 1 to be false, variable 2 to be true, and variable 3 to be true, the clause becomes true. 

Therefore, the solution to the SAT problem is:
answer: 1 -1 1
