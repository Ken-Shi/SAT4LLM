To solve this problem, we first need to understand the DIMACS format provided. The first line "p cnf 3 2" indicates that there are 3 variables and 2 clauses in the SAT problem.

Next, we look at the clauses:
1. 2 3 1 0
2. -3 1 2 0

Each clause is a disjunction of literals, where a positive number represents the variable itself and a negative number represents the negation of the variable.

Now, we can try to find a satisfying assignment for this SAT problem by trying out different combinations of variable assignments.

Let's start by trying the following assignment:
- Variable 1 is true, variable 2 is true, and variable 3 is false.
Plugging these values into the clauses:
1. 2 3 1 -> True True True -> This clause is satisfied.
2. -3 1 2 -> False True True -> This clause is satisfied.

Since both clauses are satisfied with this assignment, our final answer is:
answer: 1 1 -1
