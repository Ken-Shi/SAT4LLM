To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given DIMACS format. The first line "p cnf 3 2" indicates that there are 3 variables and 2 clauses in the problem.

The two clauses provided are:
1. -3 -1 2 0
2. -3 -2 -1 0

Now, we need to find a solution that satisfies both clauses. Let's break down the clauses:

1. -3 -1 2 0
This clause can be satisfied if variable 3 is False, variable 1 is False, and variable 2 is True.

2. -3 -2 -1 0
This clause can be satisfied if variable 3 is False, variable 2 is False, and variable 1 is False.

Therefore, a solution that satisfies both clauses is:
- Variable 1 is False
- Variable 2 is False
- Variable 3 is False

Therefore, the final answer is: 
answer: -1 -2 -3
