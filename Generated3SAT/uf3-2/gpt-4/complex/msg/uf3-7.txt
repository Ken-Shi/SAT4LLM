This problem is asking to find a satisfying assignment for the given Boolean formula. The formula is given in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), here is how you can interpret the representation:

- The "p cnf 3 2" line indicates that the formula is in CNF format, has a total of 3 variables and 2 clauses.
- The numbers followed by space represent the literals (either a variable or its negation), and 0 marks the end of each clause. 
- Positive numbers correspond to the variables themselves and negative numbers correspond to the negation of the variable.

Let's interpret the given clauses:
1. The first clause (-1 3 2 0) can be represented as (?x1 V x2 V x3)
2. The second clause (-1 2 3 0) can be represented as (?x1 V x3 V x2)

The question is asking for an assignment of true (T) or false (F) to each variable (x1, x2, x3) so that the entire formula is true.

To solve, one approach is to try different combinations until we find a valid assignment.
1. Let's try assigning T to x2 and x3. This satisfies both clauses because at least one variable is true, which makes a disjunct (an OR clause) true.
2. However, x1 is negated in both clauses, so we need it to be false for the clauses to be true.

So, the assignment x1=F, x2=T, x3=T is a solution to the problem.

Answer: -1 2 3. Here, the interpretation is x1 is false (hence -1) and x2, x3 are true.
