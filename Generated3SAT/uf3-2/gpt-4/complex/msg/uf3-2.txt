The provided problem is in DIMACS format, which is usually used for providing inputs to SAT solvers. It is representing a propositional logic problem. 

To better understand this problem, let's break down its content:

- The first line: "p cnf 3 2" 
  'p' indicates the problem type and 'cnf' stands for 'Conjunctive Normal Form'. '3' is the total number of variables used in the problem and '2' is the number of disjunctions or clauses.
  
- The following lines represent the clauses (a disjunction of literals):
  '3 1 -2 0': This represents the logical statement '3 OR 1 OR NOT 2'. The '0' at the end of the line is used to terminate the clause in DIMACS format.
  '3 -1 2 0': This represents the logical statement '3 OR NOT 1 OR 2'. The '0' at the end of the line is used to terminate the clause in DIMACS format.

Now let's solve the problem:

One possible situation is that '1' and '2' are true and '3' is false. In this case, the first clause would be true (because '1' is true) and the second clause would also be true (because '2' is true).

However, to check other possible situations and to demonstrate that the clauses can be satisfied (i.e., they can be true), multiple truth assignments can be examined. If for any assignment, all the clauses are true, then the formula is satisfiable.

The key here is to find such an assignment, if it exists. 

After analyzing the clauses, it's clear that all the literals can be true at the same time. Here's one assignment which will satisfy all the clauses:
  - Let '1' be true,
  - Let '2' be true,
  - Let '3' be true.

With this assignment, you can check that all the clauses are indeed true.

Answer: '1'=true, '2'=true, '3'=true.
