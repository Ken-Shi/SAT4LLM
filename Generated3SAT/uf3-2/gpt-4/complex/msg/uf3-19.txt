This problem is formed of Boolean values and operations and can be considered a form of the Satisfiability Problem (SAT problem). The DIMACS format is a standard for encoding problems within propositional logic, with clauses separated by zeroes. The format also allows for metadata to be added. In this case, 'p cnf 3 2' stands for a propositional formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF), with a total of 3 variables and 2 clauses.

The interpretation of the problem proceeds as follows:

The clause '-3 2 1 0' is translated into 'NOT variable 3 OR variable 2 OR variable 1'.
And the clause '2 -3 -1 0' into 'variable 2 OR NOT variable 3 OR NOT variable 1'.

For SAT problems, we are looking for a true/false assignment to each variable such that the overall formula (i.e. all the clauses) is true. A negative number represents the negation of a variable (i.e. if the variable is 3, -3 represents NOT 3), and a positive number represents the variable. The 0 at the end of each clause signals the end of the clause.

We can find a solution by performing a simple trial and error on the variables. 

Potential solutions:
1. Assign True to variable 1, variable 2 and variable 3, this would fail because in the second clause NOT variable 1 is false and makes the complete clause false.
2. Assign False to variable 1, this satisfies the second clause but the first clause becomes false because of variable 1.
3. Assign True to variable 1, False to variable 2 and True to variable 3, the first clause becomes false.
4. Assign True to variable 1, variable 3 and False to variable 2, this makes both clauses true.

Therefore, the correct assignment is True to variable 1 and variable 3, and False to variable 2.

Answer: variable 1 = True, variable 2 = False, variable 3 = True
