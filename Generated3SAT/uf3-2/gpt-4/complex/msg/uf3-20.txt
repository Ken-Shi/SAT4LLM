The given problem is a SAT (satisfiability) problem in the DIMACS format. This problem is a three-variable (Let's call these variables as A, B, and C for simplicity), two-clause problem. We need to find truth assignments for these three variables that satisfy both clauses.

Here's the problem broken down step by step:

1) -3 -2 -1 0: This clause translates to NOT C AND NOT B AND NOT A. This means that for this clause to be true, all three variables A, B, and C must be false.

2) -3 -2 1 0: This clause translates to NOT C AND NOT B AND A. This means that for this clause to be true, A must be true and both B and C must be false.

If we analyze both clauses, we see that the only way to satisfy both clauses is when A is true and both B and C are false.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Answer: A = True, B = False, C = False.
