Firstly, we need to understand that this problem is written in CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) under DIMACS format. 

In DIMACS format, the first line defines the type of problem and the size of problem. Here, `p cnf 3 2` means it's a propositional (p) problem, in conjunctive normal form (cnf), with 3 variables and 2 clauses.

After this introductory line, each subsequent line represent a clause until a 0 is encountered. Positive numbers represent the presence of this number while negative number represent the negation of the number.

We can translate the clauses from this example problem from DIMACS into more human-readable version:
1. `2 1 3 0` becomes `(x2 OR x1 OR x3)` ,
2. `2 -3 1 0` becomes `(x2 OR NOT x3 OR x1)`.

The task now is to find a truth value assignment for each variable such that every clause has at least one true literal.

After inspecting the clauses, it's clear that x2 appears in every clause. Given that, we can start by setting x2 to 1 (true). With x2=true, each clause automatically becomes true, regardless of the values of x1 and x3.

Answer: `(x1,x2,x3) = (either True or False,True, either True or False)`
