The provided SAT problem is encoded in the DIMACS format, which is used for defining instances of SAT (Satisfiability) problems. Here's a breakdown of what the problem is saying:

1. "p cnf 3 2" signifies that there are 3 variables used (numbered 1, 2, and 3) and there are 2 clauses.

2. "-3 2 1 0" is the first clause. This could be interpreted as "not variable 3 OR variable 2 OR variable 1". In this clause, "-3" means the negation/not of variable 3, "2" refers to variable 2, "1" refers to variable 1, and "0" marks the end of the clause.

3. "-3 2 -1 0" is the second clause. This could be interpreted as "not variable 3 OR variable 2 OR not variable 1". Here, "-3" means the negation/not of variable 3, "2" refers to variable 2, "-1" refers to the negation/not of variable 1, and "0" marks the end of the clause.

Next, we need to find a solution that will satisfy both clauses. Let's consider the following assignments:

1. For the first clause, "-3 2 1 0", let's take "3" as False, "2" as True, and "1" as True. This assignment makes the entire clause True because it's the OR operation among the values (False OR True OR True is True).

2. For the second clause, "-3 2 -1 0", let's take "3" as False, "2" as True, and "1" as True. This assignment makes the entire clause True as well, because (False OR True OR False is True).

So, the solution is: variable 3 is FALSE, variable 2 is TRUE, and variable 1 is TRUE.

Answer: 3 = FALSE, 2 = TRUE, 1 = TRUE
