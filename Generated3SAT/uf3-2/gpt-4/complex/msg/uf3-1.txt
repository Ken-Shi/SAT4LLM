This problem is written in a DIMACS format used for specifying instances of boolean satisfiability problems (SAT). 

Let's break down the problem:

In the first line 'p cnf 3 2', 
- 'p' identifies we are declaring our problem details.
- 'cnf' specifies that our problem is in conjunctive normal form (a conjunction of one or more clauses, where a clause is a disjunction of literals). 
- '3' represents the highest numbered variable that is used (in this case the variables are 1, 2 and 3).
- '2' specifies the number of clauses in our problem; so here there are two clauses.

In the next two lines,
- '-2 -3 -1 0' is the first clause; it is equivalent to (!2 or !3 or !1) (since '-' before a number represents negation-not; '0' is end of clause marker).
- '-1 -3 -2 0' is the second clause; equivalent to (!1 or !3 or !2).

Equivalent logical interpretation of the entire problem would be ((not 1 or not 2 or not 3) and (not 1 or not 2 or not 3)). Each clause needs to be satisfied for this problem to have a solution.

For each variable it can be True(T) or False(F). Note that in SAT, they don?t literally need to be first-degree variables; they can be Boolean expressions themselves. As long as the variables can only hold True or False, you can treat these expressions as variables because the whole expression will evaluate to either True or False.

To satisfy these clauses the variables need to be assigned in such a way that at least one literal in each clause is true.

As you can see, for both the clauses, same conditions are given i.e (!1, !2, !3), simplified into not of (1 and 2 and 3). Therefore, if we take any one of them as false the clause will be satisfied regardless of the value of other literals.

Let's set variable 1 as False.  This still leaves remaining litarals to satisfy the clause. This doesn't necessarily imply the only solution but it implies the simplest solution.

Consequently,
- Variable 1 = False
- Variable 2 = Either False or True
- Variable 3 = Either False or True

*answer : 1=False, 2=False, 3=False* (This solution makes the clause false)
or,
*answer : 1=False, 2=False, 3=True* (This solution makes the clause false)
or,
*answer : 1=False, 2=True, 3=True* (This solution makes the clause true)
or,
*answer : 1=False, 2=True, 3=False* (This solution makes the clause false)
As long as, not 1 is True, all combinations of 2 and 3 will satisfy the clause.
