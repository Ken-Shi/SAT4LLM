The problem presented is a Boolean SAT (satisfiability) problem in conjunctive normal form (CNF), where 3 is the number of variable and 2 is the number of clauses.

The two clauses are: 
1) (x2 OR x3 OR x1)
2) (NOT x3 OR x1 OR x2)

Fetching the clauses, we can determine if the clauses can be satisfiable (T=True, F=False) through trying possible combinations of Boolean values for the SAT problem. The aim is to find a combination where both clauses are true. 

We can start by assigning truth values arbitrarily.

Let's start with trivial assignment:
x1=T, x2=T, x3=T. This clearly satisfies both clauses. 

Therefore, one plausible solution for the given SAT problem is:

Answer: x1=T, x2=T, x3=T
