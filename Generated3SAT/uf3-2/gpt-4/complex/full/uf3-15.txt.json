                "content": "DIMACS is one of the standard formats for representing a boolean satisfiability problem.The first inputs are p cnf 3 2, where 'p' identifies the problem, 'cnf' stands for conjunctive normal form, '3' indicates there are three variables and '2' represents the number of clauses in the problem.\n\nThese variables will be denoted by x1, x2, x3. Here -x indicates that the variable x is negated.\n\nThe two lines after the first:\n- 1 2 -3 0 represents the clause (x1 OR x2 OR NOT x3)\n- 3 -2 1 0 represents the clause (x3 OR NOT x2 OR x1)\n\nHere 0 is not a variable and is used as the terminator of each clause.\n\nTo solve the problem, look for any rows which contain both a variable and its negation (for example, 1 and -1), because these are always true.\n\nSince every clause in a satisfiability problem must be true for the problem as a whole to be true, and a clause is true if any of its literals are true, and a literal is true if its variable is true while the literal is not negated (or if the variable is false and the literal is negated).\n\nSince no clauses contain both a variable and its negation, the problem does not have an obvious immediate solution and some trial and error is needed to solve it.\n\nAnswer: \nWe can try for different values of x1, x2, x3, One of the solution could be:\nx1 = true\nx2 = false\nx3 = true\n\nThis satisfies both the clauses ((x1 OR x2 OR NOT x3) = true OR false OR NOT true = true) and ((x3 OR NOT x2 OR x1) = true OR NOT false OR true = true OR true OR true = true), Hence the given SAT problem is satisfiable for solution x1 = true, x2 = false, x3 = true. \n\nAnswer: x1 = true, x2 = false, x3 = true"
