                "content": "This problem is in conjunctive normal form (CNF), which is a format widely used in computational logic and theoretical computer science, and especially in automated theorem proving and SAT solver tools.\n\nIt's important to understand what the given data means:\n\n- The first line \"p cnf 3 2\" indicates that the CNF formula has three variables and two clauses.\n- The next lines contain the clauses. Logically, each clause is a disjunction of variables or its negation. Therefore, \"1 2 -3 0\" represents the clause \"(1 OR 2 OR NOT 3)\" and \"2 -3 -1 0\" represents the clause \"(2 OR NOT 3 OR NOT 1)\".\n- The number \u201c0\u201d at the end of each clause signals the end of that clause.\n\nAs per the problem solving, in order to solve a SAT problem, we are looking for an assignment of truth-values to the variables that makes all the clauses true and that would satisfy the CNF formula.\n\nLet's evaluate the clauses:\n\nFor the first clause - \"1 2 -3 0\"\nLet's assign \"1\" to the variable 1 and 2, and \"-1\" to variable 3. Since any clause will be true if at least one of its variables is true, our choice will make the first clause true, (since 1 OR 2 is true).\n\nNow, let's move to the second clause - \"2 -3 -1 0\"\nNotice that our previous choice of 1 for variable 2 already satisfies the second clause (since 2 is true). The value for variable 1 and 3 we made doesn't contradict the clause since NOT 3 OR NOT 1 is also true (since NOT 3 is true).\n\nSo, given that all the clauses are satisfied, hence the whole formula is satisfied.\n\nAnswer: Variable 1 = true, Variable 2 = true, Variable 3 = false"
