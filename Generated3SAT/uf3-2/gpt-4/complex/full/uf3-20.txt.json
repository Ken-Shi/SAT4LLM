This problem is a three-variable (Let's call these variables as A, B, and C for simplicity), two-clause problem. We need to find truth assignments for these three variables that satisfy both clauses.\n\nHere's the problem broken down step by step:\n\n1) -3 -2 -1 0: This clause translates to NOT C AND NOT B AND NOT A. This means that for this clause to be true, all three variables A, B, and C must be false.\n\n2) -3 -2 1 0: This clause translates to NOT C AND NOT B AND A. This means that for this clause to be true, A must be true and both B and C must be false.\n\nIf we analyze both clauses, we see that the only way to satisfy both clauses is when A is true and both B and C are false.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: A = True, B = False, C = False."
