                "content": "This is a Boolean satisfiability problem that looks for a satisfying assignment to the given Boolean formula expressed in conjunctive normal form.\n\nLet's break down the formula given in the DIMACS format. The statement \"p cnf 3 2\" means that we are given a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form consisting of three variables (1, 2, 3) and 2 clauses.\n\nThe two clauses are:\n1) 1 3 2\nThis clause implies the disjunction (Boolean OR operation) of three literals, i.e., it means 1 OR 3 OR 2.\n\n2) -3 -1 2\nThis clause implies the disjunction of -3, -1, and 2. Here, -3 and -1 mean NOT 3 and NOT 1 respectively. So, this clause translates to NOT 1 OR NOT 3 OR 2.\n\nOur task is to find a truth assignment for the variables 1, 2, 3 that will satisfy both clauses of the given formula.\n\nAn initial interpretation can be {1 = true, 2 = true, 3 = true}, but it does not satisfy the second clause which needs either 3 or 1 to be false or 2 to be true.\n\nSo we can change the interpretation to {1 = false, 2 = true, 3 = false}.\n\nThis interpretation satisfies both clauses:\n1) 1 OR 3 OR 2 translates to false OR false OR true which results in true\n2) NOT 1 OR NOT 3 OR 2 translates to true OR true OR true which results in true.\n\nThis shows that this assignment satisfies the given SAT Problem.\n\nAnswer: \n1=false, 2=true, 3=false"
