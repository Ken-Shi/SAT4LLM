The aim is to find a combination where both clauses are true. \n\nWe can start by assigning truth values arbitrarily.\n\nLet's start with trivial assignment:\nx1=T, x2=T, x3=T. This clearly satisfies both clauses. \n\nTherefore, one plausible solution for the given SAT problem is:\n\nAnswer: x1=T, x2=T, x3=T\n"
