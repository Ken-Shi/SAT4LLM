To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we'll use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment. 

First, let's interpret the constraints provided in DIMACS format:
-2 1 3 0
-2 -1 -3 0
1 -2 -3 0
-2 -3 1 0
-2 -1 -3 0
-2 -3 1 0
-3 -1 -2 0
-3 1 -2 0

Next, let's create the corresponding logical expressions:
(?x2 ? x1 ? x3)
(?x2 ? ?x1 ? ?x3)
(x1 ? ?x2 ? ?x3)
(?x2 ? ?x3 ? x1)
(?x2 ? ?x1 ? ?x3)
(?x2 ? ?x3 ? x1)
(?x3 ? ?x1 ? ?x2)
(?x3 ? x1 ? ?x2)

Now, we can feed this problem to a SAT solver to get the solution.

Final answer:
answer: SATISFIABLE
Assignment: x1 = False, x2 = True, x3 = True
