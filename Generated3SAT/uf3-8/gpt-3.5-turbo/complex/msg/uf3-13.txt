To solve this SAT problem, we need to examine the clauses in DIMACS format:

1. (2, -3, 1) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 2=True, 3=False, and 1=True.
2. (-2, -3, 1) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 2=False, 3=False, and 1=True.
3. (1, -3, 2) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 1=True, 3=False, and 2=True.
4. (1, -2, -3) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 1=True, 2=False, and 3=False.
5. (1, -2, -3) - This clause is a duplicate of the previous clause and does not affect the solution.
6. (3, -2, 1) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 3=True, 2=False, and 1=True.
7. (1, -3, -2) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 1=True, 3=False, and 2=False.
8. (-3, 1, -2) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 3=False, 1=True, and 2=False.

Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is: 2=False, 3=False, 1=True.

answer: 2=False, 3=False, 1=True
