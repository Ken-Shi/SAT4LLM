To solve this SAT problem provided in DIMACS format, we can first rewrite the clauses in a more readable form:

1. (-2 or -1 or -3)
2. (-2 or -3 or -1)
3. (-2 or -3 or -1)
4. (-1 or -3 or -2)
5. (-1 or -3 or -2)
6. (1 or -3 or -2)
7. (-2 or 3 or -1)
8. (-3 or -1 or -2)

To solve this, we can apply the following line of thoughts:

1. Look for clauses with a single literal. In this case, we see that the 6th clause is (1 or -3 or -2), which means we can assign variable 1 as true. This also makes clause 1, 2 and 7 satisfied.

2. After assigning variable 1 as true, we can simplify the remaining clauses:
-4. (-3 or -2)
-5. (-3 or -2)
-8. (-3 or -2)

3. Since clauses 4, 5, and 8 are the same, we can conclude that variable 3 must be set to false to satisfy these clauses.

4. Assigning variable 3 as false, we can simplify the clauses further:
-4. (-2)
-5. (-2)
-8. (-2)

5. From the simplified clauses, we can see that variable 2 must be set to false to satisfy all the remaining clauses.

Therefore, the solution to the SAT problem is:
answer: 1 -3 -2
