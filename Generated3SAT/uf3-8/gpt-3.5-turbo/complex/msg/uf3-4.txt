To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to find a satisfying assignment for the variables. 

The problem is represented in conjunctive normal form (CNF) with 3 variables and 8 clauses. 

The clauses are as follows:

1. (-1 OR -2 OR -3)
2. (-3 OR 1 OR -2)
3. (3 OR 1 OR 2)
4. (-2 OR -3 OR -1)
5. (1 OR -3 OR -2)
6. (-1 OR -2 OR -3)
7. (-2 OR 3 OR 1)
8. (-3 OR 1 OR 2)

We can try to satisfy these clauses by assigning truth values to the variables. 

Let's start:
- If we assign (1 = True, 2 = False, 3 = True), we can satisfy all clauses except clause 4.
- If we assign (1 = True, 2 = True, 3 = True), we can satisfy all clauses.
- If we assign (1 = False, 2 = True, 3 = True), we can satisfy all clauses except clause 8.

Therefore, the SAT problem is satisfiable, and the satisfying assignment is:
1 = False
2 = True
3 = True

answer: 1 = False, 2 = True, 3 = True
