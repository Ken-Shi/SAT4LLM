To solve this SAT problem, we need to interpret the DIMACS format. The first line "p cnf 3 8" tells us that there are 3 variables and 8 clauses in the problem.

Next, we look at the clauses:
1. 3 -2 -1 0
2. 3 2 -1 0
3. -1 -2 3 0
4. -2 3 -1 0
5. -2 -1 3 0
6. -2 3 1 0
7. -2 -1 3 0
8. -1 3 -2 0

We can see that these clauses represent logical statements involving the variables -1, -2, and 3. Each clause has 3 literals and ends with a 0.

To solve this problem, we can try to find an assignment of true and false values to the variables -1, -2, and 3 that satisfies all the clauses.

Looking at the clauses, we see that clause 6 conflicts with itself, as it states both -2 and 3 should be true while -2 should be false. This is a contradiction and makes the problem unsolvable.

answer: UNSATISFIABLE
