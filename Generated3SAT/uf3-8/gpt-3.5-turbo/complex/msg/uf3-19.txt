To solve this SAT problem, we need to convert the DIMACS format into a more readable form. The problem consists of 3 variables and 8 clauses:

1. (-3 OR -2 OR -1)
2. (-2 OR -3 OR -1)
3. (-1 OR -3 OR -2)
4. (-2 OR -3 OR -1)
5. (3 OR -2 OR -1)
6. (-1 OR -3 OR -2)
7. (-3 OR 1 OR 2)
8. (-3 OR -1 OR -2)

We can now try to find a solution by assigning values to the variables. By looking at the clauses, we observe that Clause 7 (-3 OR 1 OR 2) is the only clause that includes variable 3, and it has a positive term for 3. Therefore, we can assign 3 to True. Now, looking at the other clauses:

-1 (-3 OR -2 OR -1) - Since 3 is True, this clause can be satisfied by setting -1 to False.
-2 (-2 OR -3 OR -1) - Since 3 is True, this clause can be satisfied by setting -2 to False.

With these assignments, all of the clauses are satisfied, and the problem is solved.

answer: 3 False False
