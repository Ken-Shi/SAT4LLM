To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to find a satisfying assignment for the variables that makes the given CNF formula true. The CNF formula has 3 variables and 8 clauses.

Let's go through the clauses one by one:

1. Clause 1: -2 1 3
   This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 2 to False, variable 1 to True, and variable 3 to True.

2. Clause 2: 1 -2 -3
   This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 1 to True, variable 2 to False, and variable 3 to False.

3. Clause 3: 2 1 3
   This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 2 to True, variable 1 to True, and variable 3 to True.

4. Clause 4: 2 3 1
   This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 2 to True, variable 3 to True, and variable 1 to False.

5. Clause 5: 1 -2 3
   This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 1 to True, variable 2 to False, and variable 3 to True.

6. Clause 6: -2 1 -3
   This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 2 to False, variable 1 to True, and variable 3 to False.

7. Clause 7: 2 -3 1
   This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 2 to True, variable 3 to False, and variable 1 to True.

8. Clause 8: 2 1 3
   This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 2 to True, variable 1 to True, and variable 3 to True.

Therefore, the satisfying assignment for this SAT problem is:
1. Variable 1 is True
2. Variable 2 is False
3. Variable 3 is True

answer: 1 -2 3
