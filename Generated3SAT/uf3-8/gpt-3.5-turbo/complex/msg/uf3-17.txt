To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to convert the clauses into a readable format first:

1. (2 v -1 v 3)
2. (2 v 3 v -1)
3. (-2 v -1 v 3)
4. (2 v 3 v -1)
5. (3 v 2 v -1)
6. (2 v -3 v -1)
7. (-1 v -3 v 2)
8. (-1 v -2 v -3)

Next, we need to check all possible combinations of variables to find a satisfying assignment. Let's denote the variables as follows: 1 for -1, 2 for -2, and 3 for -3.

For the first clause, we can see that either 2 or 3 must be true. Let's choose 2 to be true.
For the second clause, 2 or 3 must be true. 2 is already true, so 3 must also be true.
For the third clause, either -2 or -1 must be true. Since 2 is true, -2 must be false, so -1 is true.
For the fourth clause, 2 or 3 must be true. Both are already true.
For the fifth clause, 3 or 2 must be true. Both are already true.
For the sixth clause, 2 or -3 must be true. Both are already true.
For the seventh clause, -1 or -3 or 2 must be true. All are already true.
For the eighth clause, -1 or -2 or -3 must be true. All are already true.

Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:
answer: 2 3 -1
