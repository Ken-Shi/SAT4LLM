To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will first analyze the clauses given:
-3 -1 2 0
: This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 3 to False, variable 1 to False, and variable 2 to True.
3 1 2 0
: This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 3 to True, variable 1 to True, and variable 2 to True.
3 2 1 0
: This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 3 to True, variable 2 to True, and variable 1 to True.
1 3 -2 0
: This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 1 to True, variable 3 to True, and variable 2 to False.
-3 1 -2 0
: This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 3 to False, variable 1 to True, and variable 2 to False.
-3 2 1 0
: This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 3 to False, variable 2 to True, and variable 1 to True.
-3 2 1 0
: This clause can also be satisfied by setting variable 3 to False, variable 2 to True, and variable 1 to True.
-1 3 2 0
: This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 1 to False, variable 3 to True, and variable 2 to True.

Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:
answer: 3 -1 2
