To solve this problem, we can use a SAT solver to determine if there exists a satisfying assignment for the given formula. 

Here is the line of thoughts:
- The first line "p cnf 3 8" indicates that there are 3 variables and 8 clauses in the formula.
- The clauses are provided in DIMACS format where each line represents a clause and ends with a '0'.
- We will input the given formula into a SAT solver to check if there exists a satisfying assignment.

Now, let's input the given formula into a SAT solver and check for a satisfying assignment.

Answer: unsatisfiable
