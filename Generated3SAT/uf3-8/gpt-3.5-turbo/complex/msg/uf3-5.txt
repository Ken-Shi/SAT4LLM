To solve this SAT problem, we need to find a solution that satisfies all the given clauses in DIMACS format.

Let's break down the DIMACS format:
- The first line "p cnf 3 8" indicates that there are 3 variables and 8 clauses in the problem.
- The subsequent 8 lines represent the clauses. Each clause ends with a '0'.

Now, let's interpret and simplify each clause:
1. (-1 v -3 v -2) = (-1 OR -3 OR -2)
2. (-1 v -3 v 2) = (-1 OR -3 OR 2)
3. (1 v -2 v 3) = (1 OR -2 OR 3)
4. (-1 v -3 v -2) = (-1 OR -3 OR -2)
5. (-2 v -3 v -1) = (-2 OR -3 OR -1)
6. (-3 v -2 v -1) = (-3 OR -2 OR -1)
7. (3 v -1 v -2) = (3 OR -1 OR -2)
8. (-2 v -1 v -3) = (-2 OR -1 OR -3)

Now, let's combine all these clauses to find a solution that satisfies all of them.

Combining all the clauses:
(-1 OR -3 OR -2) AND (-1 OR -3 OR 2) AND (1 OR -2 OR 3) AND (-1 OR -3 OR -2) AND (-2 OR -3 OR -1) AND (-3 OR -2 OR -1) AND (3 OR -1 OR -2) AND (-2 OR -1 OR -3)

After simplification, we can see that this problem does not have a solution because the clauses are contradictory and cannot be satisfied simultaneously.

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: No solution.
