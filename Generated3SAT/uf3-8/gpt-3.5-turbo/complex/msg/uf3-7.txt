To solve this SAT problem, we need to attempt to find a satisfying assignment for the given formula in DIMACS format.

First, let's examine each clause:
1. (-1 v 3 v -2) -> This clause is satisfied when either 3 or -2 is true.
2. (-3 v -2 v -1) -> This clause is satisfied when either -3 or -2 or -1 is true.
3. (1 v -3 v -2) -> This clause is satisfied when either 1 or -3 or -2 is true.
4. (-2 v -3 v 1) -> This clause is satisfied when either -3 or 1 is true.
5. (-3 v 1 v -2) -> This clause is satisfied when either 1 or -2 is true.
6. (1 v -2 v -3) -> This clause is satisfied when either 1 or -2 or -3 is true.
7. (-3 v 2 v 1) -> This clause is satisfied when either 2 or 1 is true.
8. (-2 v -3 v -1) -> This clause is satisfied when either -3 or -2 or -1 is true.

Now, we can see that there is a satisfying assignment for this formula:
1. Assign 1=true, 2=false, 3=false.

Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:
answer: 1 -2 -3
