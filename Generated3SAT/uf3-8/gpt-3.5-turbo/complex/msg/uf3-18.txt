To solve this SAT problem, we first need to interpret the DIMACS format given. The first line indicates that there are 3 variables and 8 clauses in the problem. Each subsequent line represents a clause, where a positive number represents the variable being included in the clause and a negative number represents the negation of the variable.

Now, let's translate the clauses into a more readable format:
(3 OR 2 OR NOT 1)
(NOT 1 OR 3 OR NOT 2)
(2 OR 3 OR NOT 1)
(2 OR NOT 3 OR NOT 1)
(2 OR 3 OR NOT 1)
(2 OR 3 OR NOT 1)
(NOT 1 OR 3 OR 2)
(2 OR NOT 1 OR 3)

To solve the problem, we need to find an assignment of true or false to variables 1, 2, and 3 that satisfies all of the clauses. Let's check each clause one by one:

Clause 1: (3 OR 2 OR NOT 1) is satisfied by assigning 1=false, 2=true, and 3=true
Clause 2: (NOT 1 OR 3 OR NOT 2) is satisfied by assigning 1=false, 2=false, and 3=true
Clause 3: (2 OR 3 OR NOT 1) is satisfied by assigning 1=false, 2=true, and 3=true
Clause 4: (2 OR NOT 3 OR NOT 1) is satisfied by assigning 1=false, 2=true, and 3=false
Clause 5: (2 OR 3 OR NOT 1) is satisfied by assigning 1=false, 2=true, and 3=true
Clause 6: (2 OR 3 OR NOT 1) is satisfied by assigning 1=false, 2=true, and 3=true
Clause 7: (NOT 1 OR 3 OR 2) is satisfied by assigning 1=false, 2=true, and 3=true
Clause 8: (2 OR NOT 1 OR 3) is satisfied by assigning 1=false, 2=true, and 3=true

Therefore, the solution to the SAT problem is:
answer: 1=false, 2=true, 3=true
