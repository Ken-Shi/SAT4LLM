To solve this SAT problem in DIMACS format, we need to identify the variables and their corresponding values in the CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) formula. 

The DIMACS format indicates that there are 3 variables and 8 clauses in this problem. 

The variables are:
- x1 (represented by 1)
- x2 (represented by 2)
- x3 (represented by 3)

The clauses are:
1. (-1 OR -2 OR 3)
2. (-2 OR -1 OR 3)
3. (-1 OR -2 OR 3)
4. (-2 OR -1 OR 3)
5. (-2 OR 3 OR -1)
6. (3 OR -2 OR -1)
7. (-2 OR 3 OR -1)
8. (3 OR -1 OR -2)

Now we can try to simplify this problem by identifying any redundant or contradictory clauses. By examining the clauses, we can see that clauses 3 and 4 are identical, as well as clauses 5 and 7. 

So, the simplified clauses are:
1. (-1 OR -2 OR 3)
2. (-2 OR -1 OR 3)
5. (-2 OR 3 OR -1)
6. (3 OR -2 OR -1)

Now we can try to find a solution or prove that there is no satisfying assignment. 

answer: This SAT problem is satisfiable. A possible solution is x1=false, x2=false, x3=true.
