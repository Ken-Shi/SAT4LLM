                "content": "First, we need to translate the DIMACS format to a format that is more easily understandable. The first line \"p cnf 3 8\" tells us that there are 3 variables and 8 clauses in this problem. The following lines represent the clauses in the problem.\n\nThe clauses can be translated as:\n1. (~1 v ~3 v ~2)\n2. (~3 v ~1 v ~2)\n3. (~2 v ~3 v ~1)\n4. (~1 v ~2 v ~3)\n5. (~3 v ~1 v ~2)\n6. (~3 v ~1 v ~2)\n7. (~1 v ~2 v ~3)\n8. (~1 v 2 v ~3)\n\nTo solve this SAT problem, we can apply the resolution method. By resolving the clauses together, we can simplify the problem and look for a contradiction.\n\nApplying resolution method:\n1. Resolve (1) and (4): (~1 v ~3) \n2. Resolve (5) and (6): (~3 v ~1 v ~2)\n3. Resolve (2) and (8): (~1 v ~2 v -2)\n\nNow we can see that there is a contradiction in the third resolved clause which states that both \u00ac2 and 2 are in the same clause. This is impossible, and therefore the original problem is unsatisfiable.\n\nanswer: unsatisfiable"
