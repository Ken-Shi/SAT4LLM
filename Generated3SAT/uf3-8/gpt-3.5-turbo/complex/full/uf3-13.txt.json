(-2, -3, 1) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 2=False, 3=False, and 1=True.\n3. (1, -3, 2) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 1=True, 3=False, and 2=True.\n4. (1, -2, -3) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 1=True, 2=False, and 3=False.\n5. (1, -2, -3) - This clause is a duplicate of the previous clause and does not affect the solution.\n6. (3, -2, 1) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 3=True, 2=False, and 1=True.\n7. (1, -3, -2) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 1=True, 3=False, and 2=False.\n8. (-3, 1, -2) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 3=False, 1=True, and 2=False.\n\nTherefore, the solution to this SAT problem is: 2=False, 3=False, 1=True.\n\nanswer: 2=False, 3=False, 1=True"
