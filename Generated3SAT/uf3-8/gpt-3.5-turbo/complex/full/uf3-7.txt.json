(-1 v 3 v -2) -> This clause is satisfied when either 3 or -2 is true.\n2. (-3 v -2 v -1) -> This clause is satisfied when either -3 or -2 or -1 is true.\n3. (1 v -3 v -2) -> This clause is satisfied when either 1 or -3 or -2 is true.\n4. (-2 v -3 v 1) -> This clause is satisfied when either -3 or 1 is true.\n5. (-3 v 1 v -2) -> This clause is satisfied when either 1 or -2 is true.\n6. (1 v -2 v -3) -> This clause is satisfied when either 1 or -2 or -3 is true.\n7. (-3 v 2 v 1) -> This clause is satisfied when either 2 or 1 is true.\n8. (-2 v -3 v -1) -> This clause is satisfied when either -3 or -2 or -1 is true.\n\nNow, we can see that there is a satisfying assignment for this formula:\n1. Assign 1=true, 2=false, 3=false.\n\nTherefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:\nanswer: 1 -2 -3"
