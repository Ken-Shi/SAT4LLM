(2 v 3 v -1)\n5. (3 v 2 v -1)\n6. (2 v -3 v -1)\n7. (-1 v -3 v 2)\n8. (-1 v -2 v -3)\n\nNext, we need to check all possible combinations of variables to find a satisfying assignment. Let's denote the variables as follows: 1 for -1, 2 for -2, and 3 for -3.\n\nFor the first clause, we can see that either 2 or 3 must be true. Let's choose 2 to be true.\nFor the second clause, 2 or 3 must be true. 2 is already true, so 3 must also be true.\nFor the third clause, either -2 or -1 must be true. Since 2 is true, -2 must be false, so -1 is true.\nFor the fourth clause, 2 or 3 must be true. Both are already true.\nFor the fifth clause, 3 or 2 must be true. Both are already true.\nFor the sixth clause, 2 or -3 must be true. Both are already true.\nFor the seventh clause, -1 or -3 or 2 must be true. All are already true.\nFor the eighth clause, -1 or -2 or -3 must be true. All are already true.\n\nTherefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:\nanswer: 2 3 -1"
