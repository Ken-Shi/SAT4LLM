The CNF formula has 3 variables and 8 clauses.\n\nLet's go through the clauses one by one:\n\n1. Clause 1: -2 1 3\n   This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 2 to False, variable 1 to True, and variable 3 to True.\n\n2. Clause 2: 1 -2 -3\n   This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 1 to True, variable 2 to False, and variable 3 to False.\n\n3. Clause 3: 2 1 3\n   This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 2 to True, variable 1 to True, and variable 3 to True.\n\n4. Clause 4: 2 3 1\n   This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 2 to True, variable 3 to True, and variable 1 to False.\n\n5. Clause 5: 1 -2 3\n   This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 1 to True, variable 2 to False, and variable 3 to True.\n\n6. Clause 6: -2 1 -3\n   This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 2 to False, variable 1 to True, and variable 3 to False.\n\n7. Clause 7: 2 -3 1\n   This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 2 to True, variable 3 to False, and variable 1 to True.\n\n8. Clause 8: 2 1 3\n   This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 2 to True, variable 1 to True, and variable 3 to True.\n\nTherefore, the satisfying assignment for this SAT problem is:\n1. Variable 1 is True\n2. Variable 2 is False\n3. Variable 3 is True\n\nanswer: 1 -2 3"
