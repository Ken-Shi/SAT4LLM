The given SAT problem is a 3-SAT problem, which is a special case of Boolean Satisfiability problems where each clause has exactly three literals.

Understanding the clauses:

1) -1 -3 -2 0 : This means that at least one of var1, var3 and var2 must be false.
2) -1 -3 2 0 : This means that at least one of var1, var3 and NOT var2 must be false.
3) 1 -2 3 0 : This means that at least one of NOT var1, var2 and var3 must be false.
4) -1 -3 -2 0 : This is a repeat of the first clause, so it doesn't contribute new information.
5) -2 -3 -1 0 : This means that at least one of var2, var3, and var1 must be false.
6) -3 -2 -1 0 : This means that at least one of var3, var2, and var1 must be false.
7) 3 -1 -2 0 : This means that at least one of NOT var3, var1, and var2 must be false.
8) -2 -1 -3 0 : This means that at least one of var2, var1, and var3 must be false.

From the second clause (-1 -3 2 0), we know that at least one of var1, var3 and NOT var2 be false. So, let's assume var1 is false. It does not violate any clause so far.

Assuming var1 is false, from the first clause (-1 -3 -2 0), we know that at least one of var3, var2 must be false now. Lets assume var2 is false.

However, assuming var2 is false directly contradicts with the clause (3 -1 -2 0). So, this wrong and let's change it. Let's assume var2 is true.

Now all clauses seem to hold true and do not contradict any assumptions.

Hence, our assumption of var1 as false and var2 as true holds water.

Solution:
However we haven't assigned a value to var3 yet. We need to check if any of the clauses force var3 to have a specific value, if not var3 can be either true or false.

On checking we see that var3 does not have a fixed value, hence it depends on the case and can be either true or false.

answer: var1=0, var2=1, var3=Don't care (var3 can be either 0 or 1)
