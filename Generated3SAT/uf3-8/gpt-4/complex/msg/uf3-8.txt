Here, you are given a Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The SAT problem aims to determine whether the given set of clauses (i.e., a disjunction of literals) can be satisfied. The goal is to assign True (T) or False (F) values to each variable in such a way that each clause contains at least one True literal, and hence the entire formula evaluates to True.

Looking at the given set of clauses, the last clause demands every literal (variables) to be True, because it is a conjunction of all variables i.e., (3 ? 2 ? 1). Hence we need to assign True to all the three variables 1 , 2, 3.

Before we finalize our thoughts, let's cross-verify with respect to all other clauses:
1) Clause 1: (3 V 2 V ~1) -> (T V T V ~T) = T V T = T -> Hence, clause 1 is satisfied.
2) Clause 2: (~2 V 1 V 3) -> (~T V T V T) = F V T = T -> Hence, clause 2 is satisfied.
3) Clause 3: (3 V 1 V 2) -> (T V T V T) = T -> Hence, clause 3 is satisfied.
4) Clause 4: (~3 V 2 V ~1) -> (~T V T V ~T) = F V T = T -> Hence, clause 4 is satisfied.
5) Clause 5: (2 V 3 V 1) -> (T V T V T) = T -> Hence, clause 5 is satisfied.
6) Clause 6: (1 V ~3 V 2) -> (T V ~T V T) = T -> Hence, clause 6 is satisfied.
7) Clause 7: (1 V 3 V 2) -> (T V T V T) = T -> Hence, clause 7 is satisfied.

Answer: With the above variable assignments, every clause evaluates to true, thereby giving a solution to the given SAT problem. Thus, the final assignment that fulfills this SAT problem is 1 = True, 2 = True, 3 = True.
