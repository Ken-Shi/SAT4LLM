This SAT problem is encoded in DIMACS format (cnf), which is one of the standard ways SAT problems are represented computationally. The 'cnf' stands for 'Conjunctive Normal Form', which is a logical formula consisting of a conjunction (AND) of one or more clauses, where a clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals (variables or their negations). The format also includes information about the number of variables and clauses.

In the problem given, there are 3 variables (denoted by the numbers 1, 2, 3) and 8 clauses (represented by each line ending with 0). In each clause, negated variables are represented with '-' before them. 

There is no specific method to solve these problems manually as they are generally solved by SAT solvers computationally. However, we can try to analyze and simplify it manually. 

Looking at the clauses, you can see that some are repeated. We can safely eliminate the duplicates, as they don't affect the truth value of the overall expression. This leaves us with the following:

-2 -1 -3 0 (Clause 1)
1 -3 -2 0   (Clause 2)
-2 3 -1 0   (Clause 3)
-3 -1 -2 0  (Clause 4)

Considering the input in terms of variables:
Clause 1: -2 -1 -3 0 implies that at least one of 2, 1, 3 is false 
Clause 2: 1 -3 -2 0 implies that either 1 is true or at least one of 3, 2 is false
Clause 3: -2 3 -1 0 implies that either 3 is true or at least one of 2, 1 is false
Clause 4: -3 -1 -2 0 implies that at least one of 3, 1, 2 is false 

Analyzing these clauses, it's clear that setting 1 to true, 2 to true, and 3 to false makes all the clauses true and thus, solves the problem.

Answer: 
1 = True 
2 = True
3 = False
