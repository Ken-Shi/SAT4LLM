Firstly, let's understand the problem. The problem is given in the DIMACS format, which is used for conjunctive normal form (CNF) expressions of SAT problems. "p cnf 3 8" means that we are dealing with a problem with three variables, and there are eight clauses. Each clause has three literals L_it is in the form of disjunction (e.g., p v q v r) and the problem is to find a solution where all clauses are satisfied.

Now, let's decode the clauses: 
- 3 -1 2 0: means (x3 v ~x1 v x2)
- -3 -1 2 0: means (~x3 v ~x1 v x2)
- 2 -3 -1 0: means (x2 v ~x3 v ~x1)
- -3 -2 -1 0: means (~x3 v ~x2 v ~x1)
- -3 -1 2 0: means (~x3 v ~x1 v x2)
- -3 -1 -2 0: means (~x3 v ~x1 v ~x2)
- -1 -3 2 0: means (~x1 v ~x3 v x2)
- -3 2 1 0: means (~x3 v x2 v x1)

Now, our challenge is to assign truth values (true or false, represented as 1 and 0 or -1, respectively) to the literals such that all the clauses are satisfied.

Let's try assigning truth values
- From first and the fifth clause, we can see that x1 should be 'false'.
- The second, third and fourth clause indicating that x3 should be 'false'.
- For the x2, it should be 'true', as per the first clause.

So, based on these deductions, we have found the boolean assignments that satisfy the clauses and solve the problem.

Answer: -1 -3 2
This states that the variable x1 is 'false', x2 is 'true' and x3 is 'false'.
