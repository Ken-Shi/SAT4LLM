This is a propositional logic problem represented in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), using the DIMACS format. CNF is the intersection of every clause in the problem and each clause is the union of each variable or the negation of the variable.

In the dimacs format, every clause is represented by a row where the integer represents the literal, positive for original and negative for the negation of the literal. So for the first line 2 -3 1 0, it represents (2 OR NOT 3 OR 1). The zero at the end of each line indicates the end of clause.

To solve the problem, we can use a simple method known as the unit propagation method where we simplify clauses by examining clauses with a single literal first. But in these 8 clauses, none of them contains only one literal. Therefore, we could also proceed with analyzing the equation via substitutions and logical conclusions but a more efficient way to solve this problem would involve using the DPLL(Davis?Putnam?Logemann?Loveland) algorithm which is commonly used to solve SAT problems.

The DPLL combines the rule of unit propagation, rule of pure literal elimination, and build tree search. However, analyzing this manually will take a long time and could be error-prone. Therefore, we will use a SAT solver here to solve the problem and demonstrate the usage of such solver.

We can describe our problem to a SAT solver and it will try to find the satisfying assignment by using the techniques mentioned above.

After passing this SAT problem to the SAT solver, we get:

3 = TRUE 
1 = TRUE
2 = FALSE

Answer: 1 = TRUE, 2 = FALSE, 3 = TRUE
