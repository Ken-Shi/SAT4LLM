Let's start by understanding what this problem is stating:

In the first line, "p cnf 3 8", 'p' means problem, 'cnf' stands for conjunctive normal form, '3' stands for number of variables and '8' stands for number of clauses.

Each line after the first one denotes a clause. A positive number means the variable is present as it is and a negation symbol '-' before a number means the NOT of that variable is present. '0' symbol is a delimiter.

Each clause is in OR form; meaning if any of the literals in a clause is TRUE, then the clause is TRUE.

All the clauses are AND'd together, so for the whole statement to be TRUE, all clauses must be TRUE.

We now try to find a solution by iterating through the clauses and picking an assignment that makes each clause true.

Looking at the clauses it seems solution can be found by having 1=false, 2=true, 3=true. 

Let's verify this:

- The first clause: -1 -2 -3 0 becomes TRUE (false or not true or not true) 

- The second clause: -3 1 -2 0 becomes TRUE (not true or false or not true)

- The third clause: 3 1 2 0 becomes TRUE (true or false or true)

- The fourth clause: -2 -3 -1 0 becomes TRUE (not true or not true or false)

- The fifth clause: 1 -3 -2 0 becomes TRUE (false or not true or not true)

- The sixth clause: -1 -2 -3 0 becomes TRUE (false or not true or not true)

- The seventh clause: -2 3 1 0 becomes TRUE (not true or true or false)

- The eighth clause: -3 1 2 0 becomes TRUE (not true or false or true)

As each clause evaluates to TRUE, whole CNF SAT problem evaluates to TRUE with this solution.

Answer: 
1=false, 2=true, 3=true
