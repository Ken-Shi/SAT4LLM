The problem given is in DIMACS format, which is used to define instances of Constraint Satisfaction Problems. In this format, p cnf 3 8 indicates that we have a Boolean problem (cnf) with 3 variables and 8 clauses. The rest of the lines are the clauses with variables separated by spaces and each line ended with a 0.

In a clause, a positive number represents the corresponding variable, and a negative number represents the negation of the corresponding variable. A clause is satisfied if at least one variable is true. The whole cnf problem is satisfied when all clauses are satisfied.

Let's examine the clauses:

1. [2 3 1] -> variable 2 or 3 or 1 must be true.
2. [3 1 2] -> variable 3 or 1 or 2 must be true.
3. [1 3 2] -> variable 1 or 3 or 2 must be true.
4. [2 3 1] -> variable 2 or 3 or 1 must be true.
5. [2 3 -1] -> variable 2 or 3 or not 1 must be true.
6. [2 3 1] -> variable 2 or 3 or 1 must be true.
7. [2 1 3] -> variable 2 or 1 or 3 must be true.
8. [3 2 1] -> variable 3 or 2 or 1 must be true.

From those clauses, it can be clearly seen that any assignment that makes variables 2, 3 true will satisfy all clauses, because variables 2, 3 appear in every clause. For variable 1, its value doesn't affect the satisfy the clauses because it always accompanied by 2 and 3 in clauses.

Therefore, solution could be:

Answer: 1=-1, 2=1, 3=1

Satisfies all clauses, thus, it is a correct solution for the given problem. We don't have to assign a specific value to a variable when it won't impact the result.
