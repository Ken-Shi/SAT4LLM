The given problem is a propositional logic problem in the form of a Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) provided in DIMACS format. DIMACS format is a standardized text file format used to encode boolean formulas specifically for the domains of propositional logic and satisfiability testing. 

This particular CNF is built over three boolean variables and it has eight clauses. It can be interpreted as follows:

(3 OR NOT 2 OR NOT 1) AND
(3 OR 2 OR NOT 1) AND
(NOT 1 OR NOT 2 OR 3) AND
(NOT 2 OR 3 OR NOT 1) AND
(NOT 2 OR NOT 1 OR 3) AND
(NOT 2 OR 3 OR 1) AND
(NOT 2 OR NOT 1 OR 3) AND
(NOT 1 OR 3 OR NOT 2) 

The task is to find an assignment to the variables such that it satisfies all clauses (i.e., makes the entire formula TRUE). This is a classic SAT problem. 
 
Let's find an assignment:

An initial scan shows that 3 is in each clause, always in affirmative form, which means that if we assign the value TRUE to variable 3, we will satisfy all the clauses.

Now if we assign TRUE to variable 3, we can assign any boolean value to variable 1 and 2 without affecting the satisfaction of the clauses.

Therefore, in terms of the variable numbers given (1, 2, and 3), a possible solution is assigning -1, -2, and 3, which corresponds to FALSE, FALSE, and TRUE respectively for the variables 1, 2, and 3.

However, please note that SAT problems are often complex with multiple solutions. This is just one possible solution.

Answer: -1 -2 3
