Firstly, let's understand the SAT (Satisfiability) problem in DIMACS format. Please note that every number represents a variable and negations of variables are represented by negative numbers.
In these clauses:
3 2 -1 0:  Either variable 3 is TRUE or variable 2 is TRUE or variable 1 is FALSE.
-1 3 -2 0: Either variable 1 is FALSE or variable 3 is TRUE or variable 2 is FALSE.
2 3 -1 0:  Either variable 2 is TRUE or variable 3 is TRUE or variable 1 is FALSE.

The rest of the clauses follow the same logic.

Secondly, let's solve these clauses one by one:

Let's start with the first clause. If you set variable 3 to be TRUE (3), then you get a solution for the first literal.

The second literal says variable 1 should be FALSE (-1) or variable 3 should be TRUE or variable 2 should be FALSE. We already have variable 3 as TRUE (3), so the second clause is satisfied.

The third clause says that variable 2 should be TRUE (2) or variable 3 should be TRUE or variable 1 should be FALSE. Variable 3 is already TRUE (3), so the third clause is satisfied.

We find a similar pattern in the other clauses. Variable 3 being TRUE (3), the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth clauses are all satisfied.

Answer: For the given SAT problem, a possible solution will be variable 1 is FALSE, variable 2 can be either TRUE or FALSE (it doesn't really matter in this case), and variable 3 is TRUE. So a possible solution is: -1 0 3.
