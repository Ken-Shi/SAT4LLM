                "content": "The DIMACS format is used to specify SAT/SMT problems and it's a de-facto standard for such problems. In this question, \"p cnf 3 8\" means that we have 3 variables and 8 clauses. The variables are 1, 2 and 3 and they can take either true (positive) or false (negative) values. \n\nClauses are:\n1. -2 1 3 0 \n2. -2 -1 -3 0\n3. 1 -2 -3 0\n4. -2 -3 1 0 \n5. -2 -1 -3 0\n6. -2 -3 1 0\n7. -3 -1 -2 0 \n8. -3 1 -2 0\n\nA clause is satisfied if at least one of the literals is true. The problem is to find a truth assignment to the variables such that all clauses are satisfied.\n\nOne possible way to solve this manually is to try finding a solution clause by clause. Interpret negative literals as false and positive as true. \n\nLooking at the first clause and trying to negate second, we can get a hint that 2 must be false (-2), because it is negative in both these clauses. Let's keep 2 as false in our assumption and proceed.\n\nThe third clause forces 1 to be true, because to satisfy it, 1 or -3 must be true and -3 doesn't work due to the fourth clause (which will need -2 or 1 to be true). \n\nSo now we have 2 as false and 1 as true. Let's see if that can work for the rest of the clauses. \n\nThe fourth and sixth clause can be satisfied if 1 (which is true) is true, and fifth clause can be satisfied if -1 and -2 are false, which is in line with our assumptions. \n\nSeventh and eighth clauses will be satisfied if -1 is true or 1 is false and -2 is true or 2 is false. \n\nSo our assumptions satisfy all clauses. Therefore, the solution is when 1 is true (1), 2 is false (-2), and 3 can be either true or false (doesn't affect any clauses).\n\nAnswer: 1, -2. The value for 3 doesn't affect the solution, so it can be either 3 or -3."
