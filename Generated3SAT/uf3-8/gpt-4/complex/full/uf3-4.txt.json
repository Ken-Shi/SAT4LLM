                "content": "Let's start by understanding what this problem is stating:\n\nIn the first line, \"p cnf 3 8\", 'p' means problem, 'cnf' stands for conjunctive normal form, '3' stands for number of variables and '8' stands for number of clauses.\n\nEach line after the first one denotes a clause. A positive number means the variable is present as it is and a negation symbol '-' before a number means the NOT of that variable is present. '0' symbol is a delimiter.\n\nEach clause is in OR form; meaning if any of the literals in a clause is TRUE, then the clause is TRUE.\n\nAll the clauses are AND'd together, so for the whole statement to be TRUE, all clauses must be TRUE.\n\nWe now try to find a solution by iterating through the clauses and picking an assignment that makes each clause true.\n\nLooking at the clauses it seems solution can be found by having 1=false, 2=true, 3=true. \n\nLet's verify this:\n\n- The first clause: -1 -2 -3 0 becomes TRUE (false or not true or not true) \n\n- The second clause: -3 1 -2 0 becomes TRUE (not true or false or not true)\n\n- The third clause: 3 1 2 0 becomes TRUE (true or false or true)\n\n- The fourth clause: -2 -3 -1 0 becomes TRUE (not true or not true or false)\n\n- The fifth clause: 1 -3 -2 0 becomes TRUE (false or not true or not true)\n\n- The sixth clause: -1 -2 -3 0 becomes TRUE (false or not true or not true)\n\n- The seventh clause: -2 3 1 0 becomes TRUE (not true or true or false)\n\n- The eighth clause: -3 1 2 0 becomes TRUE (not true or false or true)\n\nAs each clause evaluates to TRUE, whole CNF SAT problem evaluates to TRUE with this solution.\n\nAnswer: \n1=false, 2=true, 3=true"
