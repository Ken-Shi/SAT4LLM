                "content": "To solve this SAT problem, let us first understand the encoding.\n\n- The first line `p cnf 3 8` indicates that it is a conjunctive normal form (CNF) problem involving three variables (1, 2, 3) and eight clauses.\n- Each of the remaining lines represent a clause. For instance, `-3 -1 2 0` is a clause which could be interpreted as '(NOT 3 OR NOT 1 OR 2)', with the ending '0' just indicating the end of that clause.\n   \nNow, we will iterate through the clauses and try to assign truth values to the variables in a way that satisfies all clauses.\n\n1. If we start with the first clause `-3 -1 2 0` and set `3=F`, `1=F` and `2=T` it satisfies the first clause.\n2. The second clause `3 1 2 0`, however, becomes a contradiction, because to satisfy this clause we need `3=T`, which contradicts to the previous condition.\n3. So, let's reassign: `3=T`, `2=T`. And now both clauses are fine.\n4. The third clause `3 2 1 0` already fits these conditions.\n5. The fourth clause `1 3 -2 0` contradicts because to satisfy this clause we need to have `2=F`.\n6. So, let's reassign `2=F` and `1=T`.\n7. Now, checking the remaining clauses: `-3 1 -2 0`, `-3 2 1 0`, `-3 2 1 0`, `-1 3 2 0`, it seems we found a solution that satisfies all clauses, i.e. `1=T`, `2=F`, `3=T` or in SAT solver output form: '1 -2 3'.\n\nAnswer: 1 -2 3"
