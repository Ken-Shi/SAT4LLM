Each number before a 0 represents a literal, and each clause is terminated by a 0. The overall problem is a conjunction of these clauses, and the goal is to find an assignment of truth values to the literals that satisfies all the clauses.\n\nTo solve the SAT problem, we typically start by finding assignments that lead to the smallest number of remaining unsolved clauses and then explore remaining clauses accordingly.\n\nThe given SAT problem has 3 variables and 8 clauses. For each clause, the 0 is not a literal, but marks the end of the clause. So for each clause, we only look at the literals preceding each 0.\n\nLet's solve the clauses one by one:\n\n1. -3 -2 -1 0: it means that at least one from 1, 2 and 3 must be false.\n2. -2 -3 -1 0: it also says that at least one from 1, 2 and 3 must be false.\n3. -1 -3 -2 0: this repeats the same requirement again.\n4. -2 -3 -1 0: this is same as clause 2\n5. 3 -2 -1 0: it means that 3 is true or at least one from 1, 2 must be false.\n6. -1 -3 -2 0: this is same as clause 3\n7. -3 1 2 0: it means that 3 is false or both 1 and 2 are true.\n8. -3 -1 -2 0: it means that 3 is false or both 1 and 2 are false.\n\nConsidering all these conditions, we can now decide that to satisfy all clauses, 3 should be true and one from 1 and 2 must be false.\n\n\nWe would pick 1 as false and 2 to be true.\n\n\nAnswer: (3=True, 1=False, 2=True)"
