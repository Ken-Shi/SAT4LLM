So, let's assume var1 is false. It does not violate any clause so far.\n\nAssuming var1 is false, from the first clause (-1 -3 -2 0), we know that at least one of var3, var2 must be false now. Lets assume var2 is false.\n\nHowever, assuming var2 is false directly contradicts with the clause (3 -1 -2 0). So, this wrong and let's change it. Let's assume var2 is true.\n\nNow all clauses seem to hold true and do not contradict any assumptions.\n\nHence, our assumption of var1 as false and var2 as true holds water.\n\nSolution:\nHowever we haven't assigned a value to var3 yet. We need to check if any of the clauses force var3 to have a specific value, if not var3 can be either true or false.\n\nOn checking we see that var3 does not have a fixed value, hence it depends on the case and can be either true or false.\n\nanswer: var1=0, var2=1, var3=Don't care (var3 can be either 0 or 1)"
