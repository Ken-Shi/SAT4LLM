                "content": "Firstly, let's understand the problem. The problem is given in the DIMACS format, which is used for conjunctive normal form (CNF) expressions of SAT problems. \"p cnf 3 8\" means that we are dealing with a problem with three variables, and there are eight clauses. Each clause has three literals L_it is in the form of disjunction (e.g., p v q v r) and the problem is to find a solution where all clauses are satisfied.\n\nNow, let's decode the clauses: \n- 3 -1 2 0: means (x3 v ~x1 v x2)\n- -3 -1 2 0: means (~x3 v ~x1 v x2)\n- 2 -3 -1 0: means (x2 v ~x3 v ~x1)\n- -3 -2 -1 0: means (~x3 v ~x2 v ~x1)\n- -3 -1 2 0: means (~x3 v ~x1 v x2)\n- -3 -1 -2 0: means (~x3 v ~x1 v ~x2)\n- -1 -3 2 0: means (~x1 v ~x3 v x2)\n- -3 2 1 0: means (~x3 v x2 v x1)\n\nNow, our challenge is to assign truth values (true or false, represented as 1 and 0 or -1, respectively) to the literals such that all the clauses are satisfied.\n\nLet's try assigning truth values\n- From first and the fifth clause, we can see that x1 should be 'false'.\n- The second, third and fourth clause indicating that x3 should be 'false'.\n- For the x2, it should be 'true', as per the first clause.\n\nSo, based on these deductions, we have found the boolean assignments that satisfy the clauses and solve the problem.\n\nAnswer: -1 -3 2\nThis states that the variable x1 is 'false', x2 is 'true' and x3 is 'false'."
