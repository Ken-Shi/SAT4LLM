                "content": "Understanding the problem. \nThis is a Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). In each clause, a \"0\" at the end indicates the end point of each clause. A positive integer represents the corresponding variable and a negative integer represents the negation of the corresponding variable. \n\nOur goal is to assign truth values (either true or false) to the variables in a way that makes the entire formula true. Each clause in the formula is a disjunction of literals (i.e., either a variable or its negation), and the whole formula is a conjunction of these clauses. \n\nReading the problem.\n- The first line \"p cnf 3 8\" refers to the problem type and size. \"p\" signifies that this is a problem instance, \"cnf\" means that the problem is in conjunctive normal form, \"3\" is the maximum variable index (i.e., there are three variables), and \"8\" is the total number of clauses.\n- The following 8 lines are the clauses of the formula.\n\nSolving the problem.\nWe can see that the clauses are not consistent with each other - we have both \"1 3 -2 0\" and \"1 -3 -2 0\" as clauses, which cannot be both satisfied, and similarly for other conflicting pairs. Thus, it seems like the problem doesn't have a solution.\n\nAnswer: No solution."
