                "content": "This SAT problem is encoded in DIMACS format (cnf), which is one of the standard ways SAT problems are represented computationally. The 'cnf' stands for 'Conjunctive Normal Form', which is a logical formula consisting of a conjunction (AND) of one or more clauses, where a clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals (variables or their negations). The format also includes information about the number of variables and clauses.\n\nIn the problem given, there are 3 variables (denoted by the numbers 1, 2, 3) and 8 clauses (represented by each line ending with 0). In each clause, negated variables are represented with '-' before them. \n\nThere is no specific method to solve these problems manually as they are generally solved by SAT solvers computationally. However, we can try to analyze and simplify it manually. \n\nLooking at the clauses, you can see that some are repeated. We can safely eliminate the duplicates, as they don't affect the truth value of the overall expression. This leaves us with the following:\n\n-2 -1 -3 0 (Clause 1)\n1 -3 -2 0   (Clause 2)\n-2 3 -1 0   (Clause 3)\n-3 -1 -2 0  (Clause 4)\n\nConsidering the input in terms of variables:\nClause 1: -2 -1 -3 0 implies that at least one of 2, 1, 3 is false \nClause 2: 1 -3 -2 0 implies that either 1 is true or at least one of 3, 2 is false\nClause 3: -2 3 -1 0 implies that either 3 is true or at least one of 2, 1 is false\nClause 4: -3 -1 -2 0 implies that at least one of 3, 1, 2 is false \n\nAnalyzing these clauses, it's clear that setting 1 to true, 2 to true, and 3 to false makes all the clauses true and thus, solves the problem.\n\nAnswer: \n1 = True \n2 = True\n3 = False"
