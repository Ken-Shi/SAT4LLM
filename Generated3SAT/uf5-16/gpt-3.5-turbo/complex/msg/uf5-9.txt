To solve this problem, we can write the CNF as a system of equations:
(2 or 1 or 4) and (1 or -3 or -5) and ...
With 5 variables and 16 clauses, we are looking for a solution where at least one of the literals in each clause is true.

Starting with a model where all variables are false, we can evaluate each clause to see if the model satisfies all clauses.

1. (2 or 1 or 4) = True (assigning 2 to True)
2. (1 or -3 or -5) = True
3. (2 or 5 or 4) = False (None of the literals are true)
4. (-5 or 2 or -3) = False 
5. (-3 or 4 or 5) = True (assigning 4 to True)
6. (2 or -3 or 4) = True
7. (4 or 3 or 5) = True
8. (-5 or 3 or 2) = True
9. (-3 or -5 or 4) = True
10. (1 or 2 or -3) = True
11. (-3 or 1 or -4) = True
12. (5 or 4 or 1) = True
13. (-1 or 2 or 4) = True
14. (4 or 1 or -5) = True
15. (-3 or -1 or -5) = False
16. (5 or -4 or -3) = True

Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:
answer: 2 -1 4 3 -5
