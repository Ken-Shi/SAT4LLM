To solve this SAT problem in DIMACS format, we need to convert the constraints into a readable format. The header "p cnf 5 16" tells us that this is a SAT problem with 5 variables and 16 clauses.

Here are the clauses in the DIMACS format:
1. -5 4 -3 0
2. 2 3 4 0
3. -4 -5 -2 0
4. 3 1 5 0
5. -4 -2 -5 0
6. -2 -1 -4 0
7. -2 4 -5 0
8. -3 -4 1 0
9. -5 -4 3 0
10. -5 3 -4 0
11. 2 3 -5 0
12. -4 1 -2 0
13. -5 -4 2 0
14. 3 -1 -4 0
15. -2 1 4 0
16. 1 -3 -5 0

Now, let's try to simplify the expressions according to the given clauses in DIMACS.

As we try to satisfy the clauses, we can eliminate certain variables by observing the presence of negative and positive occurrences of the variable in the given clauses. 

Taking this into account, we can identify a solution to the given SAT Problem encoded in DIMACS format:

answer: 2 -1 -3 -4 -5
