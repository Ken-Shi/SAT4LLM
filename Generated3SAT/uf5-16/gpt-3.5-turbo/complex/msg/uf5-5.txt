To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. 
The DIMACS format specifies that there are 5 variables and 16 clauses in the problem.

Let's represent the problem in a more readable format:
1. ?2 ? ?1 ? ?4
2. 4 ? 3 ? ?5
3. ?2 ? ?5 ? ?4
4. ?2 ? ?1 ? ?5
5. ?2 ? ?4 ? ?1
6. ?2 ? ?4 ? 1
7. ?5 ? ?2 ? ?4
8. ?4 ? ?1 ? ?5
9. ?2 ? 3 ? 1
10. ?5 ? 4 ? ?2
11. 3 ? ?5 ? ?4
12. ?1 ? ?4 ? ?3
13. 5 ? 3 ? ?4
14. ?2 ? ?4 ? 3
15. ?2 ? ?5 ? ?1
16. 1 ? ?5 ? ?2

Now, let's apply the DPLL algorithm:

1. Choose variable 1
    - Set variable 1 to False
    - Simplify the problem based on this assignment
    - Clauses 4, 6, 9, and 16 become unit clauses
2. Choose variable 4
    - Set variable 4 to False
    - Simplify the problem based on this assignment
    - Clauses 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, and 14 become unit clauses
3. Choose variable 3
    - Set variable 3 to False
    - Simplify the problem based on this assignment
    - Clauses 2, 9, 11, 13, and 14 become unit clauses
4. Choose variable 5
    - Set variable 5 to False
    - Simplify the problem based on this assignment
    - Clauses 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, and 15 become unit clauses
5. Choose variable 2
    - Set variable 2 to False
    - Simplify the problem based on this assignment
    - Clauses 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, and 16 become unit clauses

After applying the DPLL algorithm, we have found the solution:
answer: 1 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5
