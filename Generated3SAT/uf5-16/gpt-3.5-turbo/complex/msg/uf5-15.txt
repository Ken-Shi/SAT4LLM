To solve this SAT problem, we will use a method called the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. We start by assigning truth values to the variables.

Let's analyze the DIMACS format:
- We have 5 variables and 16 clauses.

Now, we will systematically go through the clauses and check if any of them can be satisfied based on our truth value assignments.

1. Clause 5 -2 1: This can be satisfied by setting variables 5, -2, and 1 to true.
2. Clause -3 -1 5: Can be satisfied by setting variables -3, -1, and 5 to true.
3. Clause 5 -1 3: Can be satisfied by setting variables 5, -1, and 3 to true.
4. Clause 4 -3 1: Can be satisfied by setting variables 4, -3, and 1 to true.
5. Clause -1 -2 5: Can be satisfied by setting variables -1, -2, and 5 to true.
6. Clause 5 1 4: Can be satisfied by setting variables 5, 1, and 4 to true.
7. Clause 4 -2 1: Can be satisfied by setting variables 4, -2, and 1 to true.
8. Clause -4 -1 5: Can be satisfied by setting variables -4, -1, and 5 to true.
9. Clause 2 -3 5: Can be satisfied by setting variables 2, -3, and 5 to true.
10. Clause 4 5 -1: Can be satisfied by setting variables 4, 5, and -1 to true.
11. Clause 4 3 -2: Can be satisfied by setting variables 4, 3, and -2 to true.
12. Clause -2 3 1: Can be satisfied by setting variables -2, 3, and 1 to true.
13. Clause 5 -4 1: Can be satisfied by setting variables 5, -4, and 1 to true.
14. Clause 4 -3 -2: Can be satisfied by setting variables 4, -3, and -2 to true.
15. Clause -1 -4 -3: Can be satisfied by setting variables -1, -4, and -3 to true.
16. Clause 5 -3 -2: Can be satisfied by setting variables 5, -3, and -2 to true.

All clauses can be satisfied, so the solution to this SAT problem is:
answer: 1 1 1 1 1
