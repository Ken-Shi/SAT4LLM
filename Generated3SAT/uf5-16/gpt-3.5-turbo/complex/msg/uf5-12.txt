To solve this SAT problem, we will analyze the given clauses in DIMACS format:

1. 4 1 3 0
2. 4 -1 5 0
3. -5 -3 4 0
4. 5 1 3 0
5. 5 3 -1 0
6. 2 5 3 0
7. 2 4 3 0
8. 4 2 -1 0
9. 5 4 -1 0
10. 5 2 4 0
11. 3 5 2 0
12. -2 4 1 0
13. 2 5 -1 0
14. 3 1 4 0
15. 4 2 5 0
16. 4 -1 2 0

By inspecting the given clauses, we can see that this problem can be represented as a system of linear equations where each number corresponds to a variable (e.g. 1 corresponds to x1, 2 corresponds to x2, and so on).

We can see some patterns emerge within the clauses, such as the repeated appearance of variables like 4, 5, 3, and 2 in multiple clauses. By analyzing these patterns, we can simplify the problem and find a solution.

Let us now determine a solution to the given SAT problem:

answer: 4 -1 -3 -5 -2
