To solve this SAT problem, we will interpret the given DIMACS format:
- The first line indicates that there are 5 variables and 16 clauses in the problem.
- Each of the following 16 lines represents a clause in conjunctive normal form (CNF), where a "0" at the end of the line denotes the end of the clause.

Now, let's analyze each clause:
1. -3 5 -1: Either variable 3 is false, or variable 5 is true, or variable 1 is false.
2. -1 3 5: Either variable 1 is false, or variable 3 is true, or variable 5 is true.
3. 3 -2 5: Either variable 3 is true, or variable 2 is false, or variable 5 is true.
4. 3 -2 5: Same clause as 3.
5. 1 3 -4: Either variable 1 is true, or variable 3 is true, or variable 4 is false.
6. -5 -1 -2: Either variable 5 is false, or variable 1 is false, or variable 2 is false.
7. 1 -5 -4: Either variable 1 is true, or variable 5 is false, or variable 4 is false.
8. 5 -3 -4: Either variable 5 is true, or variable 3 is false, or variable 4 is false.
9. -4 -2 5: Either variable 4 is false, or variable 2 is false, or variable 5 is true.
10. 3 -4 5: Either variable 3 is true, or variable 4 is false, or variable 5 is true.
11. -1 3 -4: Either variable 1 is false, or variable 3 is true, or variable 4 is false.
12. 2 3 5: Either variable 2 is true, or variable 3 is true, or variable 5 is true.
13. 2 -1 5: Either variable 2 is true, or variable 1 is false, or variable 5 is true.
14. 4 -1 3: Either variable 4 is true, or variable 1 is false, or variable 3 is true.
15. 5 3 2: Either variable 5 is true, or variable 3 is true, or variable 2 is true.
16. 5 -4 3: Either variable 5 is true, or variable 4 is false, or variable 3 is true.

Now, we will try to satisfy these clauses and provide our final answer.

answer: The solution to the SAT problem is:
1=0, 2=1, 3=1, 4=0, 5=1
