To solve this SAT problem, we can use a truth assignment method where we try to satisfy all clauses. Let's assign truth values to the variables and see if we can find a satisfying assignment:

Let's denote the variables as follows:
1: x1
2: x2
3: x3
4: x4
5: x5

We can now go through each clause and try to find a satisfying assignment:

Clause 1: -2 3 -5
Assign x2 = False, x3 = True, x5 = False

Clause 2: -1 -3 -5
Assign x1 = False, x3 = False, x5 = False

Clause 3: -5 1 -4
Assign x5 = False, x1 = True, x4 = False

Clause 4: -5 -4 -3
Assign x5 = False, x4 = False, x3 = False

Clause 5: 3 -5 -1
Assign x3 = True, x5 = False, x1 = False

Clause 6: 1 -3 -4
Assign x1 = True, x3 = False, x4 = False

Clause 7: -1 -3 -4
Assign x1 = False, x3 = False, x4 = False

Clause 8: -1 -2 -5
Assign x1 = False, x2 = False, x5 = False

Clause 9: -1 -4 -3
Assign x1 = False, x4 = False, x3 = False

Clause 10: -1 -4 2
Assign x1 = False, x4 = False, x2 = True

Clause 11: -4 -3 -2
Assign x4 = False, x3 = False, x2 = False

Clause 12: -3 1 -4
Assign x3 = False, x1 = True, x4 = False

Clause 13: -5 2 -4
Assign x5 = False, x2 = True, x4 = False

Clause 14: -5 -2 -1
Assign x5 = False, x2 = False, x1 = False

Clause 15: -2 3 -5
Assign x2 = False, x3 = True, x5 = False

Clause 16: 5 -4 2
Assign x5 = True, x4 = False, x2 = True

Therefore, a satisfying assignment for the given SAT problem is:
x1 = False
x2 = False
x3 = True
x4 = False
x5 = False

answer: x1=False, x2=False, x3=True, x4=False, x5=False
