To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm to recursively search for a satisfying assignment. 

The first step is to convert the given CNF formula into a more readable form:

(1 v 4 v 3)
(-2 v -5 v 3)
(-5 v -1 v 4)
(-3 v 1 v 2)
(5 v 3 v -2)
(4 v -2 v -3)
(4 v -2 v 1)
(1 v 3 v 4)
(2 v 1 v -5)
(-2 v 4 v 1)
(3 v 1 v -5)
(-5 v -3 v 4)
(1 v 4 v 5)
(3 v -5 v 4)
(1 v -3 v -4)
(4 v 1 v 3)

Start with an empty assignment and recursively assign truth values to variables to satisfy the clauses. If a clause becomes unsatisfiable, backtrack to the most recent decision point and try a different assignment. Continue this process until a satisfying assignment is found or it is determined that no such assignment exists.

Let's start the DPLL algorithm with the given CNF formula.

The solution is as follows:

Choose variable 1 and assign it to True:
(1 v 4 v 3) satisfies
(-5 v 3) satisfies
(-3 v 2) satisfies
(4 v -3) satisfies
(4 v 1) satisfies
(1 v 3 v 4) satisfies
(2 v 1) satisfies
(4 v 1) satisfies
(-5 v 1) satisfies
(1 v 4 v 5) satisfies
(3 v 4) satisfies
(1 v -3) satisfies
(4 v 3) satisfies

Therefore, the assignment {1=True, 2=True, 3=True, 4=True, 5=True} satisfies all the clauses.

answer: 1 2 3 4 5
