To solve this SAT problem, we can use the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. 

Starting with the initial information in DIMACS format:
p cnf 5 16
5 -1 4 0
-3 4 1 0
1 -3 -2 0
-2 1 5 0
2 1 5 0
-1 -2 5 0
3 4 2 0
5 -2 -1 0
3 4 -2 0
-3 4 1 0
-2 3 1 0
-2 5 3 0
1 -4 -3 0
1 5 4 0
5 2 1 0
1 4 -3 0

We start by choosing a variable for assignment. Let's start with variable 1 and assign it as true (1).
After assigning variable 1 as true, we can simplify the formula by filtering out all clauses containing variable 1 or its negation -1:
-3 -2 0
-2 5 0
-4 -3 0

Next, we repeat the process and choose another variable. Let's assign variable 2 as true (1). Simplifying the formula further by filtering out clauses containing variable 2 or its negation -2:
-3 0
-4 -3 0

Choose variable 3 and assign it as false (0):
-4 0

At this point, all remaining clauses can be satisfied by assigning the remaining variables. So, we assign variable 4 as true (1) and variable 5 as false (0):
This gives the final assignment:
1: True
2: True
3: False
4: True
5: False

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: 1 1 0 1 0
