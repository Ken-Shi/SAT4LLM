To solve this SAT problem, we need to check if there is a combination of true/false assignments to the variables that satisfies all the clauses in the CNF.

The CNF formula given can be translated into the following clauses:
1. (-5 v -3 v -1)
2. (-3 v 2 v -1)
3. (-3 v 5 v 2)
4. (4 v 5 v -3)
5. (2 v -1 v 4)
6. (2 v -1 v -4)
7. (-5 v -1 v -3)
8. (-5 v -3 v 2)
9. (4 v -3 v -1)
10. (3 v -1 v -5)
11. (-5 v 2 v -3)
12. (2 v -1 v -3)
13. (-1 v 3 v -5)
14. (-1 v -5 v 4)
15. (4 v -5 v -3)

We can now solve this system of equations to find a satisfying assignment.

answer: -5 -3 1 -4 2
