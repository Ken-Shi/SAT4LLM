To solve the SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will apply the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm which involves recursively searching for a possible assignment of truth values to the variables. 

Let's go through the problem and simplify the clauses:
1. (5, 1, -4) - This clause is satisfied when 5 is true, 1 is true, and -4 is false.
2. (4, 5, -1) - This clause is satisfied when 4 is true, 5 is true, and -1 is false.
3. (5, 2, -1) - This clause is satisfied when 5 is true, 2 is true, and -1 is false.
4. (-1, -2, 4) - This clause is satisfied when either -1 is true or -2 is true or 4 is true.
5. (5, 3, 4) - This clause is satisfied when 5 is true, 3 is true, and 4 is true.
6. (-2, 1, 3) - This clause is satisfied when either -2 is true or 1 is true or 3 is true.
7. (-2, -1, 5) - This clause is satisfied when either -2 is true or -1 is true or 5 is true.
8. (-2, 5, -4) - This clause is satisfied when either -2 is true or 5 is true or -4 is true.
9. (-1, -5, 4) - This clause is satisfied when either -1 is true or -5 is true or 4 is true.
10. (3, -1, 4) - This clause is satisfied when 3 is true, -1 is false, and 4 is true.
11. (4, 3, -1) - This clause is satisfied when 4 is true, 3 is true, and -1 is false.
12. (-1, 5, 3) - This clause is satisfied when either -1 is true or 5 is true or 3 is true.

Now, let's try to find a solution for the given clauses:
- Let's say 5 is true. Then 1, 2, 3, and 4 must be false (from clauses 1, 2, 3). This would also make -4 true (from clause 1). However, since 3 and -1 must be true (from clauses 10 and 4), this assignment doesn't work.
- Let's try to set 5 as false. Then, from clause 4, either -1, -2, or 4 must be true. Setting -1 as true would result in contradictions with clause 10 and 11. Setting -2 as true would result in contradictions with clause 6 and 7. Setting 4 as true would result in contradictions with clause 5 and 9.

Therefore, after evaluation of the clauses and the possible truth assignments, we can see that there is no solution that satisfies all the clauses.

answer: No solution.
