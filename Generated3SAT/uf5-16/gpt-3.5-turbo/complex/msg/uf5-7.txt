To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use the DPLL algorithm to check if the given CNF formula is satisfiable. We will start by initializing an empty assignment and maintaining a list of clauses.

The given CNF formula is:
p cnf 5 16
-1 -5 4 0
2 1 4 0
-3 -2 -5 0
4 -5 -2 0
4 -1 2 0
-1 2 -5 0
-5 4 -3 0
4 -2 -5 0
-5 -1 2 0
1 -5 2 0
4 2 -3 0
-5 4 -3 0
-1 4 2 0
-3 -5 -4 0
-5 -2 -3 0
-5 4 -3 0

1. Initializing an empty assignment: {}
2. List of clauses:
   -1 -5 4
   2 1 4
   -3 -2 -5
   4 -5 -2
   4 -1 2
   -1 2 -5
   -5 4 -3
   4 -2 -5
   -5 -1 2
   1 -5 2
   4 2 -3
   -5 4 -3
   -1 4 2
   -3 -5 -4
   -5 -2 -3
   -5 4 -3

3. Applying the DPLL algorithm:
   a. Choose variable 1 and assign it true: {1}
   b. Simplify the clauses based on the assignment:
      -1 -5 4 => -5 4
      4 -1 2 => 4 2
      -1 2 -5 => 2 -5
      -1 4 2 => 4 2
   c. Simplified clauses:
      -5 4
      2 4
      2 -5
      4 2

   d. Choose variable 4 and assign it true: {1, 4}
   e. Simplify the clauses based on the assignment:
      -5 4
      2 4
   f. Simplified clauses:
      -5
      2

   g. Choose variable 2 and assign it true: {1, 4, 2}
   h. Simplify the clauses based on the assignment:
      -5 (All clauses are satisfied)

4. The assignment {1, 4, 2} satisfies all the clauses, so the formula is satisfiable.

Final answer: answer: {1, 4, 2}
