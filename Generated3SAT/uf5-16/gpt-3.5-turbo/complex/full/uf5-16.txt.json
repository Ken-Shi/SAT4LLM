(5, 1, -4) - This clause is satisfied when 5 is true, 1 is true, and -4 is false.\n2. (4, 5, -1) - This clause is satisfied when 4 is true, 5 is true, and -1 is false.\n3. (5, 2, -1) - This clause is satisfied when 5 is true, 2 is true, and -1 is false.\n4. (-1, -2, 4) - This clause is satisfied when either -1 is true or -2 is true or 4 is true.\n5. (5, 3, 4) - This clause is satisfied when 5 is true, 3 is true, and 4 is true.\n6. (-2, 1, 3) - This clause is satisfied when either -2 is true or 1 is true or 3 is true.\n7. (-2, -1, 5) - This clause is satisfied when either -2 is true or -1 is true or 5 is true.\n8. (-2, 5, -4) - This clause is satisfied when either -2 is true or 5 is true or -4 is true.\n9. (-1, -5, 4) - This clause is satisfied when either -1 is true or -5 is true or 4 is true.\n10. (3, -1, 4) - This clause is satisfied when 3 is true, -1 is false, and 4 is true.\n11. (4, 3, -1) - This clause is satisfied when 4 is true, 3 is true, and -1 is false.\n12. (-1, 5, 3) - This clause is satisfied when either -1 is true or 5 is true or 3 is true.\n\nNow, let's try to find a solution for the given clauses:\n- Let's say 5 is true. Then 1, 2, 3, and 4 must be false (from clauses 1, 2, 3). This would also make -4 true (from clause 1). However, since 3 and -1 must be true (from clauses 10 and 4), this assignment doesn't work.\n- Let's try to set 5 as false. Then, from clause 4, either -1, -2, or 4 must be true. Setting -1 as true would result in contradictions with clause 10 and 11. Setting -2 as true would result in contradictions with clause 6 and 7. Setting 4 as true would result in contradictions with clause 5 and 9.\n\nTherefore, after evaluation of the clauses and the possible truth assignments, we can see that there is no solution that satisfies all the clauses.\n\nanswer: No solution."
