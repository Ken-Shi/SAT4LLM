The DIMACS format specifies 5 variables and 16 clauses.\n\nLet's find the satisfying assignment by applying the DPLL algorithm step by step:\n\n1. Choose a variable, let's say x1, and assign it a truth value (either True or False).\n2. Substitute the value of x1 in all clauses.\n3. Simplify the formula and continue until all clauses are satisfied.\n\nAfter applying the DPLL algorithm and simplifying the formula, we find the following satisfying assignment:\n\nanswer: 1 -2 3 4 -5"
