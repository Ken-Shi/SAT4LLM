Let's start with variable 1 and assign it as true (1).\nAfter assigning variable 1 as true, we can simplify the formula by filtering out all clauses containing variable 1 or its negation -1:\n-3 -2 0\n-2 5 0\n-4 -3 0\n\nNext, we repeat the process and choose another variable. Let's assign variable 2 as true (1). Simplifying the formula further by filtering out clauses containing variable 2 or its negation -2:\n-3 0\n-4 -3 0\n\nChoose variable 3 and assign it as false (0):\n-4 0\n\nAt this point, all remaining clauses can be satisfied by assigning the remaining variables. So, we assign variable 4 as true (1) and variable 5 as false (0):\nThis gives the final assignment:\n1: True\n2: True\n3: False\n4: True\n5: False\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nanswer: 1 1 0 1 0"
