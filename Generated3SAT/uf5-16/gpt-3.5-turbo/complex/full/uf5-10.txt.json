(1, 5, 4)\n6. (4, 1, 5)\n7. (-3, 1, 2)\n8. (1, -3, -4)\n9. (4, 5, 1)\n10. (5, 2, -3)\n11. (-1, 4, -3)\n12. (4, -3, 1)\n13. (2, 5, 3)\n14. (3, 1, 5)\n15. (-1, 2, 5)\n16. (-5, 1, -3)\n\nNow, we will iterate through each clause and see if there exists a satisfying assignment. \n\nFor Clause 1: (2, -3, 1) - Since it contains a positive literal, we can set variable 2 to True, variable 3 to False, and variable 1 to True. This clause is satisfied.\n\nFor Clause 2: (5, 1, -3) - Following the same logic as above, this clause is also satisfied.\n\nFor Clause 3: (4, 2, 1) - This clause is satisfied if we set variable 4 to True, variable 2 to True, and variable 1 to True.\n\nFor Clause 4 - 16: Similar to the process above, we can check that all other clauses are also satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \nanswer: 2 3 1 4 5"
