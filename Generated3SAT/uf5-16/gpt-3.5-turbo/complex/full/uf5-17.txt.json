We will then try to satisfy each clause by assigning truth values to the variables.\n3. Once we find a satisfying assignment, we will write it down as the final answer.\n\nLet's start by analyzing each clause:\n1. (4 5 1) can be satisfied by assigning True to 4 and 5, and False to 1.\n2. (-1 4 -5) can be satisfied by assigning True to 4, False to 1 and 5.\n3. (5 -2 3) can be satisfied by assigning True to 5 and 3, and False to 2.\n4. (-2 3 1) can be satisfied by assigning True to 3, and False to 1 and 2.\n5. (3 -5 -1) can be satisfied by assigning True to 3 and False to 1 and 5.\n6. (-2 -1 -5) can be satisfied by assigning False to all variables.\n7. (3 -5 -1) can be satisfied by assigning True to 3 and False to 1 and 5.\n8. (-5 3 -1) can be satisfied by assigning True to 3, and False to 1 and 5.\n9. (-5 1 3) can be satisfied by assigning True to 3 and 1, and False to 5.\n10. (3 2 -1) can be satisfied by assigning True to 3 and 2, and False to 1.\n11. (-2 -5 3) can be satisfied by assigning True to 3, and False to 2 and 5.\n12. (3 4 -2) can be satisfied by assigning True to 3 and 4, and False to 2.\n13. (-2 4 1) can be satisfied by assigning True to 4, and False to 1 and 2.\n14. (2 5 -1) can be satisfied by assigning True to 2 and 5, and False to 1.\n15. (5 4 -1) can be satisfied by assigning True to 5 and 4, and False to 1.\n16. (-1 -2 3) can be satisfied by assigning True to 3, and False to 1 and 2.\n\nTherefore, a satisfying assignment is:\n1=False, 2=False, 3=True, 4=True, 5=True\n\nanswer: 1=False, 2=False, 3=True, 4=True, 5=True"
