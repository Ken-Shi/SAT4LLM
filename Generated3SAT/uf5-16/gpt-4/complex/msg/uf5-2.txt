To solve this problem, we typically use a method called the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. For simplicity, let's assign the variables starting from 1. So, initially, we assign 1 to be true.

Next, we see that when we assign 1 to be true, some clauses will be satisfied and we can remove those clauses, and remove 1 and -1 from all remaining clauses. This process is called BCP (Boolean Constraint Propagation). 

After BCP, we find that all clauses are satisfied and we have an empty clause. The reverse of True is False. So, following this method, we can go on and assign the rest of the literals values and check if they result in any conflicts. If there is a conflict, we backtrack and assign a new set of variables.

After going through the above steps, we find the following assignments:

1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

This satisfies all clauses in the SAT Problem. 

Answer: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
