This SAT problem solving involves a form of problem solving called "Boolean Satisfiability Problem" (SAT). It is one of the most fundamental problems in computer science. SAT is the problem of determining if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given boolean formula. In our case, the SAT problem is represented using the DIMACS format which is most often used standard for representing these problems.

Let's break this problem down (I will omit "0" at the end of lines as they don't affect the outcome):

1. `2 1 4`, this implies 2 OR 1 OR 4.
2. `1 -3 -5`, this implies 1 OR NOT 3 OR NOT 5.
3. `2 5 4`, this implies 2 OR 5 OR 4.
4. `-5 2 -3`, this implies NOT 5 OR 2 OR NOT 3 and so on.

Our goal is to assign true (1) or false (-1) to variables 1 through 5 to satisfy all the clauses. 

If we keep the first clause `2 1 4` true:
   Assign true (1) to 2, 1 and 4 and all clauses containing 2 or 1 or 4 become true. 
   For 5 and 3, they can be either true or false and all clauses will still be satisfied.

Answer: 1 = True, 2 = True, 3 = Either True or False, 4 = True, 5 = Either True or False.
