The given problem is in propositional logic, more specifically in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). Each line contains a Clause, and the problem requires finding a set of truth values (True/False or 1/0) for each variable to satisfy the entire formula.

Let's solve the problem line by line:

The 1st line reads as '5 OR 1 OR NOT 4', meaning that at least one of these must be true. For now, let's say that variable 5 is true since it is the most frequent variable.

For the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 10th, 15th and 16th clauses, we don't need to make any change since 5 is part of each of those clauses, implying these clauses are already satisfied.

For the 4th clause, '-1 OR -2 OR 4', 4 could be true since it doesn't contradict any of our previous choices.

For the 6th clause, '-2 OR 1 OR 3', we can pick 1 as true, since it doesn't contradict our previous choices and occurs in other clauses.

From the 7th clause (and 12th), we have '-2 OR -1 OR 5'. 5 is true, so no changes are needed.

For the 8th clause, to satisfy '-2 OR 5 OR -4', we can simply stick with our current choices.

In the 9th clause '-1 OR -5 OR 4', 4 is true so the clause is satisfied.

In the 11th clause '3 OR -1 OR 4', 4 is true so the clause is satisfied.

In the 13th clause '4 OR 3 OR -1', 4 is true so the clause is satisfied.

In the 14th clause '-1 OR 5 OR 3', 5 is true and the clause is satisfied.

So, keeping 5 and 4 as true and 1 as true maintains all the clauses as true, fulfilling the condition. We will leave 2 and 3 as false, as they are not needed.

Answer: The solution is 1 = true, 2 = false, 3 = false, 4 = true, 5 = true.
