This problem involves solving a Boolean satisfiability problem, formatted in DIMACS format.

The first line has two values, the total number of variables (5) and the total number of clauses (16). 

Every line that follows each represents a clause, and a clause is a logical disjunction of variables or their inverses. The 0 at the end of each line does not represent a variable, but is rather just a marker to indicate the end of a clause. Positive numbers are variant and negative numbers denote the variant is negated.

We can begin by looking for unit clauses, these are clauses with only one literal, but it seems that we have no unit clauses here.

Also, it is a good idea to look for pure literals, those are literals that always appear with the same polarity in all clauses. Here, the literals 1 and -4 always appear negatively in all clauses, so they are pure literals and should be set to false. 

Set {1=F, 4=F} and simplify the clauses:

-2 3 -5 0
-3  -5 0
-5 -3 0
3 -5 0
-3 0
-3 0
-2 -5 0
-3 0
-2 0
-3 -2 0
-5 2 0
-5 -2 0
-2 3 -5 0
5 -4 2 0 simplified to 5 -2 0

Some clauses became unit clauses after simplification, ?3, and -2. Set {3=F, 2=F} and simplify again:

-5 0
-5 0
-5 0
-5 0
-5 0
-5 2 0 which simplifies to -5 0

In the resulted simplified clauses is also a unit clause -5. Set {5=F}.

No more simplifications needed, and all the remained variables are pure literals. We still have one unassigned variable:

-1

Since there are occurrences of -1, let?s assign 1=F.

Having processed the clauses and unit clause simplification iteratively, we gave some values to variables in a way that fulfills the clauses. After making an assignment, we simplified the clauses (or you might say "updated" the clauses) to reflect each assignment.

Answer: {1=F, 2=F, 3=F, 4=F, 5=F}
