This problem, encoded in DIMACS format, specifies a boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), and it uses conjunctive normal form (CNF). Each line other than the first line represents a clause which is a disjunction (OR) of literals. A literal refers to a variable or a negated variable. There are five variables given in this problem (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

The first number on each line (before the 0) is either a variable or its negation. "1 4 -3 0", for example, can be read as "1 OR 4 OR NOT 3", meaning either 1 is true, 4 is true or 3 is false (or any combination of these). 

To solve this, we can use a SAT solver. However, as a theoretical manual approach:

We can start by finding a clause having only one literal. But, in case we do not have any unit clause:

Starting from 1, 1 is in many clauses, so we can make 1=TRUE first. That satisfies clauses 1, 3, 11, 14.

Next, since 4 is also in many clauses, we make 4=TRUE. This satisfies clauses 2, 6, 7, 8, 15.

Now, if we make 2=TRUE, that satisfies clause 13 and 14. Set 3=FALSE, satisfies clause 10, 15, 16.

Finally, if we set 5=FALSE, that will satisfy clause 12.

So, from the process above, we have:

answer: 1=TRUE, 2=TRUE, 3=FALSE, 4=TRUE, 5=FALSE

These answers represent a solution to the SAT problem. Note that there could be additional valid solutions to the SAT problem given, this process simply identified one possible solution and different change of variables can lead to a different potential solution, given the example of the NP-completeness of SAT problem.
