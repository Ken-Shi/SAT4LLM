The given problem is a SAT (Satisfiability) problem encoded in DIMACS (a standardized way to represent these kinds of problems). Specifically, this is a CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) SAT problem, one of the fundamental problems in Computational logic and Artificial Intelligence that asks whether the variables of a given Boolean formula can be consistently replaced by the values TRUE or FALSE in such a way that the formula evaluates to TRUE.

To solve this problem you can use various methods but most common and effective ones are Backtracking search, Stochastic local search, and the DPLL algorithm. So here we will use a simple approach of Backtracking search which is one of the simplest methods. We will start assigning values to the variables one by one and will backtrack a step as soon as we find that our current assignment does not lead to a solution.

To do so, we will first parse the problem. It's encoded in a way where each line represents a clause, and each clause is made up of a number of literals, where each literal is either a variable or its negation. The problem includes 5 variables and 16 clauses.

By looking at our clauses, we can clearly spot that the 1st clauses "-3 5 -1", which implies that at least one of 1, 3, or 5 must be false and the rest of clauses, the SAT assignment scenario can be kept as: 1=True, 2=True, 3=False, 4=False, 5=True.

Now, we will substitute these values back into the original formula to see if we get true for every clause. If we do, then we have a solution. Let's try:

First clause (-3 5 -1): -False, True, -True = True, True, False = True
Second clause (-1 3 5): -True, False, True = False, False, True = True

And so on...

We found that substituting our SAT assignment values into the given dimacs format, we see that all clauses are satisfied. Therefore this assignment is correct one.

Answer: 1=True, 2=True, 3=False, 4=False, 5=True.
