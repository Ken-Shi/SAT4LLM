Let's solve this SAT problem step by step:

1. The first clause tells us that either 5 is true, -2 is true, or 1 is true. Let's assume 5 is false. This would require both -2 and 1 to be true, otherwise the entire formula is false. However, if 1 is true, this conflicts with the 5th clause `-1 -2 5 0`, because -1 would be false and consequently, either -2 or 5 must be true. But -2 cannot be true because that would make 2 false, which conflicts with the 9th clause `2 -3 5 0`. Consequently, 5 must be true.

2. If 5 is true, we know from the 1st clause that either -2 or 1 can be false. From the 6th clause, we have `5 1 4 0` and because 5 is already true, either 1 or 4 must be true.

3. From the 12th clause `-2 3 1 0`, for this clause to hold true, we either need -2 to be true, 3 to be true or 1 to be true. If we assume -2 is true, this makes 2 false, which contradicts with the 9th clause `2 -3 5 0` since both -3 and 5 cannot be true at the same time. Hence -2 must be false, making 2 true. Now for this clause to hold, either 3 or 1 must be true.

4. Let's assume 1 is false and thus -1 is true. If both 2 and -1 are true, from the 5th clause `-1 -2 5 0`, this implies that 5 is true (which we already know is the case). 

5. Continuing with our assumption that 1 is false, 4 must be true according to the 6th clause `5 1 4 0`.

6. With 4 being true and 1 being false, the 13th clause `5 -4 1 0` means that 5 must be true, which we already know is the case.

7. So, if we plug in our determined values (5 is true, -2 is false, 2 is true, -1 is true, 1 is false, 4 is true) into the rest clauses, all them turn out to be true. Thus we have arrived at a solution.

Answer: 5=true, -2=false, 2=true, -1=true, 1=false, 4=true.
