To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format we need to find a satisfying valuation. That is a set of values (TRUE/FALSE) for each variable in the problem that makes all the clauses TRUE. Each clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals, and a clause is satisfied if at least one of its literals is TRUE. A literal can be a variable or a negated variable.

We will use the DPLL algorithm, which is a specific type of backtracking algorithm designed for the SAT problem.

1. Let's start with the first variable '1'. If no clause is conflicting with it being 'True', then make '1' = True. So, let's set '1' = True.

2. Now, go to the clause '-3 2 -1'. '1' = True, hence '-1' = False, so this clause cannot be satisfied as '-1' is in it. Therefore, the assumption of '1' = True is wrong. So, we make '1' = False.

3. Now, checking all clauses with '1' = False doesn't lead to any conflicts. So, '1' = False is correct so far.

4. Moving on to the next variable '2', let's first assume '2' = True. Hence, in the clause '2 -1 -4', '-1' = True and '-4' = True.

5. But '1' = False (from previous steps), hence '-1' = True, is a conflict. Therefore, '2' = False.

6. Going to '3', assume '3' = True. But that leaves clause '-3 2 -1' as False because '2' = False and '3' = True. Hence '-3' = False which is a conflict. So, '3' = False.

7. For '4', assume '4' = True. But in the clause '2 -1 -4', '-4' = True, and since '2' = False, this clause is False. So '4' = False.

8. Finally, for '5', there are no clauses left that are unsatisfied and contain '5' or '-5'. So, we can leave '5' without a forced value.

Hence solution of given SAT problem would be:

Answer: [-1, -2, -3, -4] 

This means variables 1, 2, 3, 4, are False, while 5 can be either True or False.
