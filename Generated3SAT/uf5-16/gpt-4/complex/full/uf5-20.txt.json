                "content": "To solve this problem, we use the method of SAT solvers, which is an algorithmic approach to solve problems of Boolean satisfiability. A satisfying assignment is a set of variables that when plugged into the clauses make all the clauses true. \n\nEach line in the DIMACS format represents a clause. The number in each clause represents a variable, the sign of the number indicates whether the variable is negated or not in the clause. \n\nFor example, the first line '-5 4 -3 0' represents the clause (!v5 OR v4 OR !v3). 0 is the end of clause. p represents the problem line. cnf 5 16 represents that there are 5 variables and 16 clauses. \n\nThe given boolean formula will be as follows,\n(!v5 OR v4 OR !v3) AND \n(v2 OR v3 OR v4) AND \n(!v4 OR !v5 OR !v2) AND \n(v3 OR v1 OR v5) AND \n(!v4 OR !v2 OR !v5) AND \n(!v2 OR !v1 OR !v4) AND \n(!v2 OR v4 OR !v5) AND \n(!v3 OR !v4 OR v1) AND \n(!v5 OR !v4 OR v3) AND \n(!v5 OR v3 OR !v4) AND \n(v2 OR v3 OR !v5) AND \n(!v4 OR v1 OR !v2) AND \n(!v5 OR !v4 OR v2) AND \n(v3 OR !v1 OR !v4) AND \n(!v2 OR v1 OR v4) AND \n(v1 OR !v3 OR !v5)\n\nWith a Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solver, we can find that there exists a satisfying assignment and the solution is:\n\nAnswer: v1=1, v2=0, v3=1, v4=0, v5=0\n\nThis set of variables makes all clauses true. Therefore, the formula is satisfiable."
