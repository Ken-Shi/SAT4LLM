                "content": "This SAT problem is a conjunctive normal form (CNF) with five variables and sixteen clauses.\n\nTo solve it, we'll use the DPLL (Davis\u2013Putnam\u2013Logemann\u2013Loveland) algorithm, a complete, backtracking-based search algorithm for deciding the satisfiability of propositional logic formulae in conjunctive normal form.\n\nWe start by looking if there's any clause that contains only one literal (unit clause).\n\n1. There's no unit clause at the start. So let's assume 1 as true and see if we can satisfy each clause.\n2. For the first clause there's no conflict, 2 and -3 can be any value because 1 is already true.\n3. Going clause by clause, we realize clause 16 is not satisfiable: -5  1 -3, where we have 1 as true and -5 and -3 are negative. This clause can never be satisfied.\n4. We go back to step 1, now we will set 1 as false and -1 as true.\n\nNow, taking the negative assumption on literal 1 and going similar way, it conflicts with clause 3: 4 2 1 as both 1 and -1 can't be true.\n\nSo here, the given problem is unsatisfiable, no possible assignment for the given literals will satisfy all the clauses.\n\nAnswer: The given SAT problem is UNSATISFIABLE."
