So, initially, we assign 1 to be true.\n\nNext, we see that when we assign 1 to be true, some clauses will be satisfied and we can remove those clauses, and remove 1 and -1 from all remaining clauses. This process is called BCP (Boolean Constraint Propagation). \n\nAfter BCP, we find that all clauses are satisfied and we have an empty clause. The reverse of True is False. So, following this method, we can go on and assign the rest of the literals values and check if they result in any conflicts. If there is a conflict, we backtrack and assign a new set of variables.\n\nAfter going through the above steps, we find the following assignments:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, and 5\n\nThis satisfies all clauses in the SAT Problem. \n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5"
