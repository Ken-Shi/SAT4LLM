                "content": "Let's begin by interpreting the DIMACS format. 'p cnf 5 16' specifies that there are 5 variables and 16 clauses. Each clause consists of integers, which represent literals. An integer precedes a '0' which indicates the end of the clause. A positive integer represents the corresponding variable while a negative integer represents the negation of the corresponding variable. \n\nNow let's solve the problem. The approach used here is the DPLL algorithm.\n\nGiven the clauses, we don't have any unit clauses (clauses with only one literal). Therefore, we can't directly assign any true or false value to any variable right now.\n\nNext, we use the 'Pure Literal Rule'. \n\n- Variable 1 occurs as '1' and '-1', so it can't be a pure literal. \n- Variable 2 only occurs as '2', so it is a pure literal and can be set to true. \n- Variable 3 occurs as '3', so it is not a pure literal without considering others.\n- Variable 4 occurs as '4' and is not a pure literal without considering others.\n- Variable 5 occurs as '5' and '-5', so it can't be a pure literal. \n\nNow, setting variable 2 to true we can further simplify the remaining clauses:\n\nAfter applying these rules and simplifying the formula, we get:\n\n2 4 3 0              (By setting 2 to True, clause is satisfied)\n2 5 -1 0            (By setting 2 to True, clause is satisfied)\n2 4 3 0              (By setting 2 to True, clause is satisfied)\n4 2 -1 0             (By setting 2 to True, clause is satisfied)\n5 2 4 0              (By setting 2 to True, clause is satisfied)\n2 5 -1 0             (By setting 2 to True, clause is satisfied)\n4 2 5 0              (By setting 2 to True, clause is satisfied)\n4 -1 2 0             (By setting 2 to True, clause is satisfied)\n\n4 1 3 0\n4 -1 5 0\n-5 -3 4 0\n5 1 3 0\n5 3 -1 0\n-2 4 1 0\n3 1 4 0\n\nAs we can see, variable 1 appears as '1' and '-1'. And same goes for variable 5. Variable 3 only appears as '3'. Therefore, we can set variable 3 to true and the same for variable 4.\n\nAs for variable 1 and 5, we can assign true to 1 and false to 5, since their assignment does not lead to contradiction.\n\nNow we've finished making all the assignments:\n\nAnswer: 2=True, 3=True, 4=True, 1=True, 5=False"
