This problem is encoded in DIMACS format meaning it is a Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem we need to solve. The problem consists of 10 variables and 85 clauses.

To solve this problem, we can use a SAT solver algorithm or manually attempt to find a satisfying assignment by trial and error. Here's a systematic way to approach it:

1. Initialize the 10 variables (let's call them A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J) and their negations.
2. Begin with the first clause "10 -8 9 0":
   - Trying different combinations of the variables to satisfy this clause.
3. Continue to go through each clause and try different assignments until a satisfying assignment is found.

After going through all the clauses, a satisfying assignment is:

A = false
B = false
C = true
D = false
E = true
F = true
G = false
H = true
I = false
J = true

Thus, the final answer is:

answer: -A -B C -D E F -G H -I J
