The problem consists of 10 variables and 85 clauses.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a SAT solver algorithm or manually attempt to find a satisfying assignment by trial and error. Here's a systematic way to approach it:\n\n1. Initialize the 10 variables (let's call them A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J) and their negations.\n2. Begin with the first clause \"10 -8 9 0\":\n   - Trying different combinations of the variables to satisfy this clause.\n3. Continue to go through each clause and try different assignments until a satisfying assignment is found.\n\nAfter going through all the clauses, a satisfying assignment is:\n\nA = false\nB = false\nC = true\nD = false\nE = true\nF = true\nG = false\nH = true\nI = false\nJ = true\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nanswer: -A -B C -D E F -G H -I J"
