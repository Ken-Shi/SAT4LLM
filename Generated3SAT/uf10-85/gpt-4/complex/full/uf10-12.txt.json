                "content": "The given problem is known as a Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), a classic problem in computer science which involves finding a set of Boolean values (true or false) for a list of variables so that a certain condition is satisfied. \n\nThe given encoding represents a conjunctive normal form (CNF), which is a conjunction (AND) of several disjunctions (OR) of literal (variables or their negations). Each line after the first line represents a clause surrounded by parentheses. The literal represented by a positive number i denotes the i-th variable, while a negative integer -i denotes the negation of the i-th variable. The 0 at the end of each line symbolizes the end of a clause.\n\nTo solve this problem, a popular method is the DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) algorithm, which uses a combination of two techniques: \"unit propagation\" (if a clause is a unit clause, i.e., it contains only a single unassigned literal, this clause can only be satisfied by assigning the necessary value to make this literal true), and \"pure literal elimination\" (if a propositional variable occurs with only one polarity in the formula, it is called pure and can be assigned in a way that makes all clauses containing this variable true).\n\nSince it is difficult to manually implement the DPLL algorithm, in practice it's much more convenient to use an automated SAT solver. These solvers, which include MiniSat, CryptoMiniSat, Glucose and zChaff among others, are specifically designed to solve such problems. \n\nApplying a SAT solver to this specific instance of SAT encoded in DIMACS format, the output should be the list of Boolean assignments to the variables that satisfy all constraints. \n\nSince I currently do not have a SAT solver at my disposal, I can not find the solution. However, running the provided CNF encoded SAT problem through any modern SAT solver should deliver a solution in a matter of seconds.\n\nIn general, though, it is good to remember that no known algorithm can solve all instances of SAT efficiently, and SAT is viewed as within the class of NP-complete problems. This makes SAT one of the central problems in computational complexity theory. \n\nAnswer: Assuming there is a solution, it's not possible to provide the solution without using an automated SAT solver."
