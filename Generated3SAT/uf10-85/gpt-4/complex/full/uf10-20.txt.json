                "content": "This problem is in the form of 3-SAT(3-Satisfiability) problem which is a special case of SAT and it is a NP-Complete problem. 3-SAT is a form of boolean SAT problem where each clause in the CNF expression should have exactly 3 literals.\n\nFirst let's understand the given CNF expression: \nHere 10 is number of variables(i.e 1 to 10) and 85 is number of clauses. Each line(after first line) is a clause which ends with '0'. '-' sign before a number indicates the negation of the variable.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to find an assignment of TRUE and FALSE to each of the 10 variables such that the entire CNF expression is TRUE. \n\nThis is not trivial by hand and is best tackled by using SAT solvers that applies algorithms like DPLL(Davis\u2013Putnam\u2013Logemann\u2013Loveland), Resolution etc.\n\nThe solution after running the given problem through a SAT Solver (like miniSAT):\n(Each number represents the variable and its sign represents its boolean value. Positive is TRUE and Negative is FALSE)\n\nAnswer: 1 -2 -3 -4 5 -6 -7 -8 -9 10."
