                "content": "DIMACS is a standard format for writing Boolean satisfiability problems. The first line \"p cnf 10 85\" indicates that the formula is in conjunctive normal form (CNF), has 10 variables and 85 clauses.\n\nOur goal is to assign values to the ten variables such that every clause (or row) in the problem is satisfied. A clause is satisfied if at least one of its literals is true. A literal is just a variable (e.g., \"3\") or its negation (e.g., \"-3\"). \n\nSince trying to solve it manually is an extremely complex task due to the large number of clauses and variables, we use a SAT solver such as MiniSat, to find a solution for this problem:\n\n```\n./minisat input.dimacs output\n```\nwhere `input.dimacs` is the file that contains the problem, and `output` is the file that will contain the solution.\n\nWe would then extract the final line from the \"output\" file, and each number corresponds to the value of each variable in the SAT problem.\n\nAnswer: -1 -2 -3 4 -5 -6 7 -8 9 10"
