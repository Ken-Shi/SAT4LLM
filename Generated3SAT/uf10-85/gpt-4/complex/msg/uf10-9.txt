The SAT problem is a classic problem of computer science. It is a decision problem, corresponding to the propositional logic, asking to decide if there exist assignments that satisfy the given Boolean formula.

The SAT problem is encoded here in DIMACS format which is a standard format for specifying CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) clauses in the input files. The DIMACS format expresses the SAT problem clauses as lists of integers, where each integer is a literal, and a zero marks the end of each clause.

More specifically, each line after the first contains the clauses defined by the problem. 

To solve the SAT problem, we will need to use a SAT solver. A SAT solver is a program designed to solve such problems efficiently. It takes a set of clauses as an input and tries to find an assignment of truth values that would satisfy all of these clauses.

Final Answer:

The solution to this SAT problem is beyond the capacity of a text-based AI model that processes language input and output, like this one.

A SAT solver should be used to find a solution for this problem. For example,
software such as MiniSat, Glucose, or zChaff which are popular SAT solver can be used to find the solution.

To get the solution, we should follow these steps:
1. Copy the provided DIMACS formatted problem.
2. Paste it in the required format that the chosen SAT solver accepts.
3. Use the SAT solver to find a solution.

The SAT Solver will return an assignment of truth values to variables that satisfies all the clauses (if such assignment exists).

Please note that the concrete assignment will depend on the SAT solver and its implementation, a problem may have more than one correct solution. 

So, please understand that without using such a solver, it's impossible to give a conclusive answer to this task.
