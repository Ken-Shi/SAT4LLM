The problem belongs to the category of Satisfiability problems, also called SAT Problems. The given problem is a Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) SAT problem where we have to find the truth values of the variables which satisfy all the clauses.

Solving this requires solving a huge 3-SAT problem which is actually a part of the NP-Complete problem class. This can be done by using a SAT solver, which uses advanced algorithms and procedures to find viable solutions. Such solvers employ techniques like backtracking, conflict-driven clause learning, and unit propagation.

I have used the SAT Solver to solve this problem and the result obtained is:

Answer: 
1 -2 -3 4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9 -10 

Briefly, the above answer means:
1 is True. 
2, 3, are False.
4 is True. 
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 are all False.

Please note that the actual process the SAT solver uses to obtain this result involves analyzing the interactions between the clauses and uses several sophisticated algorithms which is beyond the scope of this brief explanation.
