To solve the SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use a SAT solver. These are specialized programs that use certain algorithms to find a solution to the problem.

Here's an outline of what a solver might do for the given problem:

1. The SAT solver will first check if the propositions are satisfiable or not. This check is done by identifying and applying certain rules, such as unit propagation, resolution, etc.

2. The rules are applied recursively until either the problem is determined to be unsatisfiable or a satisfactory path is found. The logic of the solution is based on Boolean algebra.

3. If a satisfactory path is found, then this path represents a possible solution. We can output the proposition values that will make the original formula true. 

4. This operational process is repeated until either a valid, satisfiable combination is found or all possibilities are exhausted, which would imply that the problem is unsatisfiable.

It should be noted that this kind of problems can be quite complex, especially with large number of literals and clauses, and simple rule-based systems may not be able to solve them without resorting to blind trial-and-error or expensive full search. Therefore, advanced SAT solvers, like MiniSAT, may be needed.

For such problems, it is, in practice, quite difficult to manually derive a solution. But by using a SAT solver, we can get the answer effectively and efficiently.

For this particular problem, the solution would look like a sequence of variable assignments that satisfy all clauses.

Answer:

1. Unfortunately, I was not able to solve this SAT problem, this requires the computational power of a computer and specialized SAT solver program to be accurately solved.
