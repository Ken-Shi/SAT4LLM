To solve this SAT problem, we need to find a satisfying assignment of truth values to the variables that make all the clauses true.

Here are the clauses given in DIMACS format:
1. (1, -2, -3)
2. (4, -3, -5)
3. (1, -5, -2)
4. (-2, 4, -5)
5. (-2, 1, -3)
6. (1, -5, 4)
7. (1, -4, -2)
8. (1, 4, -3)
9. (-3, -2, 1)
10. (-5, 2, 4)
11. (-5, 4, -3)
12. (-3, 4, -2)
13. (-2, -3, 1)
14. (1, 5, 3)

To solve this, we can use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment. After running the SAT solver, the solution is:

answer: 1 -2 3 4 5
