To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use the following steps:

1. Convert the DIMACS format into a logical expression:
   (5 OR NOT 3 OR NOT 1) AND
   (NOT 3 OR NOT 1 OR 2) AND
   (NOT 1 OR 5 OR NOT 3) AND
   (NOT 4 OR 5 OR NOT 2) AND
   (NOT 4 OR 5 OR 2) AND
   (NOT 3 OR NOT 1 OR NOT 5) AND
   (NOT 1 OR 2 OR NOT 3) AND
   (5 OR 3 OR NOT 2) AND
   (NOT 3 OR NOT 2 OR 5) AND
   (NOT 3 OR 5 OR NOT 1) AND
   (NOT 4 OR NOT 3 OR NOT 1) AND
   (NOT 3 OR NOT 5 OR NOT 4) AND
   (NOT 4 OR NOT 1 OR 5) AND
   (NOT 4 OR NOT 2 OR NOT 1)

2. Solve the logical expression using any SAT solver tool or method.

3. Write the final answer as a single solution.
