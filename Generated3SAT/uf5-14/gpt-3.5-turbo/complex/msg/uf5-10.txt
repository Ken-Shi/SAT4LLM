To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use a systematic approach called the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. This algorithm works by recursively assigning truth values to variables and simplifying the clauses based on these assignments.

1. We will start by considering the first clause: 2 3 1
   a. We can assign true to variables 2, 3, and 1 to satisfy this clause.

2. Next, we move on to the second clause: -5 -2 -3
   a. We can assign true to variable 5 and false to variables 2 and 3 to satisfy this clause.

3. Continuing in this manner, we analyze each clause and make assignments accordingly:
   -1 -4 -5: Assign true to 1, 4, and 5
   3 -5 2: Assign true to 3, 5, and 2
   -5 -3 4: Assign true to 5, 3, and 4
   2 -4 -3: Assign true to 2, 4, and 3
   2 1 5: Already satisfied
   -4 -5 1: Assign true to 4, 5, and false to 1
   3 1 2: Already satisfied
   -4 -5 -1: Assign true to 4, 5, and false to 1

4. After resolving all the clauses, we have a satisfying assignment:
   Variables:
   1 -> true
   2 -> true
   3 -> true
   4 -> true
   5 -> true

Therefore, the final answer for this SAT problem is:
answer: 1 1 1 1 1
