To solve this SAT problem, we will first decode the DIMACS format. The first line "p cnf 5 14" tells us that there are 5 variables and 14 clauses. The following lines represent the 14 clauses in conjunctive normal form.

Now, we will analyze each clause:

1. 5 -3 -1 : This clause can be satisfied by assigning TRUE to variable 5.
2. 4 5 2 : This clause can be satisfied by assigning TRUE to variables 4 and 5.
3. -1 -2 -5 : This clause can be satisfied by assigning FALSE to variables 1, 2, and 5.
4. 1 -5 -3 : This clause can be satisfied by assigning TRUE to variable 1.
5. -2 4 -5 : This clause can be satisfied by assigning FALSE to variables 2 and 5.
6. -1 -2 3 : This clause can be satisfied by assigning TRUE to variable 3.
7. -1 -5 3 : This clause can be satisfied by assigning TRUE to variable 3.
8. -1 2 4 : This clause can be satisfied by assigning TRUE to variables 2 and 4.
9. -2 3 5 : This clause can be satisfied by assigning TRUE to variables 2, 3, and 5.
10. 4 -2 -1 : This clause can be satisfied by assigning TRUE to variable 4.
11. 1 -4 -3 : This clause can be satisfied by assigning TRUE to variables 1 and 3.
12. -3 -4 1 : This clause can be satisfied by assigning TRUE to variable 1.
13. 5 -1 -2 : This clause can be satisfied by assigning TRUE to variable 5.
14. -2 4 1 : This clause can be satisfied by assigning TRUE to variables 4 and 1.

Therefore, the final assignment that satisfies all the clauses is:
1. x1 = TRUE
2. x2 = TRUE
3. x3 = TRUE
4. x4 = TRUE
5. x5 = TRUE

answer: 1 1 1 1 1
