To solve this SAT problem, we can apply the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. We will start by analyzing the clauses in the DIMACS format:

1. (-1 OR -2 OR -4)
2. (-4 OR 3 OR -2)
3. (-5 OR 3 OR 1)
4. (-4 OR -5 OR 1)
5. (3 OR -4 OR 2)
6. (-2 OR 5 OR -3)
7. (-1 OR 3 OR -5)
8. (1 OR 3 OR -4)
9. (3 OR -2 OR -5)
10. (-5 OR 4 OR -2)
11. (-4 OR 2 OR -5)
12. (-4 OR -5 OR 1)
13. (5 OR -1 OR -4)
14. (3 OR -2 OR -5)

Now, we can start with an empty assignment and recursively assign truth values to variables based on the clauses. We will also perform unit propagation and pure literal elimination as needed.

After going through the clauses, we find that the following truth assignment satisfies all the clauses:

1. Variable 1 is False
2. Variable 2 is True
3. Variable 3 is False
4. Variable 4 is False
5. Variable 5 is True

Therefore, the final answer is:

answer: -1 -2 3 -4 5
