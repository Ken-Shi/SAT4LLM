To solve this SAT problem, we first need to interpret the DIMACS format. 

The first line "p cnf 5 14" indicates that there are 5 variables and 14 clauses in the problem. The following lines represent the clauses in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). Each clause is a disjunction of literals, and each literal represents either a variable or its negation.

Here are the clauses in the problem:
1. ?3 ? ?4 ? ?1
2. ?3 ? 4 ? ?2
3. 1 ? 4 ? 5
4. ?2 ? 5 ? 1
5. ?2 ? ?3 ? 4
6. 1 ? 4 ? ?2
7. 3 ? ?2 ? 1
8. 5 ? ?2 ? 4
9. 5 ? 1 ? ?2
10. 5 ? 1 ? ?3
11. ?1 ? ?2 ? ?4
12. ?4 ? 2 ? 5
13. 4 ? 1 ? ?3
14. 5 ? ?3 ? ?2

Now, we can try to find a satisfying assignment for these clauses.

answer: This problem can be solved by SAT solvers such as MiniSat or Z3. Based on the provided clauses, one potential satisfying assignment is:
1. Variable 1 is true
2. Variable 2 is false
3. Variable 3 is false
4. Variable 4 is false
5. Variable 5 is true

Therefore, the solution is:
1 0
-2 0
-3 0
-4 0
5 0
