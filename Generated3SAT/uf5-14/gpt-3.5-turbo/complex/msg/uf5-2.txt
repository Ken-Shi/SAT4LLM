To solve this SAT problem in DIMACS format, we first write down the boolean variables corresponding to each number in the problem:

1 - x1
2 - x2
3 - x3
4 - x4
5 - x5

Now, we will go through each clause and check if it is satisfiable.

Clause 1: -2 5 3
This clause can be satisfied by setting x2 = False, x5 = True, x3 = True

Clause 2: -4 3 -5
This clause can be satisfied by setting x4 = False, x3 = True, x5 = False

Clause 3: 2 5 -1
This clause can be satisfied by setting x2 = True, x5 = True, x1 = False

Clause 4: -1 -4 -5
This clause can be satisfied by setting x1 = False, x4 = False, x5 = False

Clause 5: -4 -3 1
This clause can be satisfied by setting x4 = False, x3 = False, x1 = True

Clause 6: -1 -2 -3
This clause can be satisfied by setting x1 = False, x2 = False, x3 = False

Clause 7: 5 -1 -3
This clause can be satisfied by setting x5 = True, x1 = False, x3 = False

Clause 8: -2 -1 3
This clause can be satisfied by setting x2 = False, x1 = False, x3 = True

Clause 9: -4 5 -3
This clause can be satisfied by setting x4 = False, x5 = True, x3 = True

Clause 10: -1 -2 -4
This clause can be satisfied by setting x1 = False, x2 = False, x4 = False

Clause 11: -2 -1 -4
This clause can be satisfied by setting x2 = False, x1 = False, x4 = False

Clause 12: -1 -4 -5
This clause can be satisfied by setting x1 = False, x4 = False, x5 = False

Clause 13: -3 -1 4
This clause can be satisfied by setting x3 = False, x1 = False, x4 = True

Clause 14: -4 -3 -1
This clause can be satisfied by setting x4 = False, x3 = False, x1 = False

All clauses are satisfiable, therefore the solution is satisfiable.

answer: SATISFIABLE
