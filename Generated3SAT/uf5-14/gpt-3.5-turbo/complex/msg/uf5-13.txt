To solve the given SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we analyze each line and convert it into a logical expression based on the rules of SAT. We have 5 variables and 14 clauses as indicated by the values after "p cnf".

The clauses are:
1. (3 OR ~2 OR ~4)
2. (1 OR 2 OR 4)
3. (2 OR 3 OR 5)
4. (2 OR 1 OR 5)
5. (~4 OR ~1 OR 5)
6. (5 OR 3 OR ~1)
7. (~1 OR 5 OR ~2)
8. (~4 OR 3 OR ~2)
9. (3 OR 1 OR ~4)
10. (3 OR 5 OR ~4)
11. (~1 OR 2 OR ~4)
12. (5 OR ~4 OR 3)
13. (5 OR 1 OR ~4)
14. (5 OR 1 OR ~4)

Now, we need to simplify the logical expressions, looking for any contradictions within the clauses. Since the clauses are not contradictory, we need to find an assignment of true/false values to the variables that satisfy all the clauses.

After analyzing the clauses and logically simplifying the expressions, we find that variable 5 must be assigned true in order to satisfy the clauses. With variable 5 being true, clauses 3, 4, 6, 7, 13 are satisfied. Now, we can assign the rest of the variables as follows:
- Variable 5 is true
- Variable 3 is true (from clauses 1, 6, 12)
- Variable 1 is false (from clauses 6, 13)
- Variable 2 is false (from clauses 7, 14)
- Variable 4 is false (from clauses 5, 8, 10)

Therefore, the solution to the SAT problem is:
answer: 5 3 -1 -4 -2
