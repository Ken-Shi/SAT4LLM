To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use the following steps:

1. Start by creating a truth assignment for each variable in the CNF formula.

2. Check each clause to see if at least one literal can be satisfied by the truth assignment.

3. If a clause can be satisfied, mark it as true and move on to the next clause.

4. If a clause cannot be satisfied, try to flip the truth value of a variable to see if it can satisfy the clause.

5. Continue this process for all clauses until either a solution is found or it is determined that no solution exists.

Now, let's go through the clauses in the DIMACS format:

1. (-1 -2 5) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 1 to variable 1, 0 to variable 2, and 1 to variable 5.

2. (-2 1 -5) - This clause can be satisfied by the same truth assignment as in clause 1.

3. (1 -5 4) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 1 to variable 1, 0 to variable 5, and 1 to variable 4.

4. (-5 -4 -3) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 0 to variable 5, 0 to variable 4, and 0 to variable 3.

5. (1 4 -5) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 1 to variable 1, 1 to variable 4, and 0 to variable 5.

6. (4 -5 -3) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 1 to variable 4, 0 to variable 5, and 0 to variable 3.

7. (1 -3 5) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 1 to variable 1, 0 to variable 3, and 1 to variable 5.

8. (-5 3 1) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 0 to variable 5, 1 to variable 3, and 1 to variable 1.

9. (-1 -2 -5) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 0 to variable 1, 0 to variable 2, and 0 to variable 5.

10. (-3 2 4) - This clause cannot be satisfied with the current assignments. We need to flip the truth value of a variable.

11. (-5 -3 4) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 0 to variable 5, 0 to variable 3, and 1 to variable 4.

12. (-2 4 5) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 0 to variable 2, 1 to variable 4, and 1 to variable 5.

13. (-5 -2 1) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 0 to variable 5, 0 to variable 2, and 1 to variable 1.

14. (4 -3 -5) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning 1 to variable 4, 0 to variable 3, and 0 to variable 5.

Therefore, a satisfying assignment for this SAT problem is:
1 = 1
2 = 0
3 = 0
4 = 1
5 = 0

answer: 1 0 0 1 0
