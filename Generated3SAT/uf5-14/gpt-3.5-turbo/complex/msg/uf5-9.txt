To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to find a satisfying assignment that makes all the clauses true.

The DIMACS format indicates that there are 5 variables and 14 clauses.

Let's start by analyzing the clauses and trying to simplify them:

1. (1 2 -5) OR (-5 -3 1) OR (-4 -3 -1) OR (2 1 -5) OR (3 -5 -4) OR (2 1 -4) OR (-5 -3 2) OR (-3 2 -5) OR (-4 -5 -3) OR (-4 -3 2) OR (-1 -4 -5) OR (-3 2 -4) OR (2 3 -5) OR (1 -5 -3)

2. Since clause 2 includes variable -5, we know that -5 must be true.
3. Clause 8 becomes (-3 2), which means either -3 or 2 must be true.
4. From clause 7, (2 -5) becomes (2), so 2 must be true.
5. From clause 6, (1 -4) is true, so either 1 or -4 must be true.
6. From clause 13, (2 3 -5) becomes (2 3), so 2 and 3 must be true.
7. From clause 14, (1 -5) becomes (1), so 1 must be true.
8. From clause 1, (1 2) is true, so 1 and 2 must be true.

Therefore, the solution that satisfies all the clauses is:
1 = true
2 = true
3 = true
-4 = true
-5 = true

answer: 1 2 3 -4 -5
