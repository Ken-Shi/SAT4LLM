To solve this SAT problem, we can start by analyzing the given clauses in DIMACS format:

1. Clause 1: -1 -2 -4 0
This means that at least one of variables 1, 2, or 4 must be false.

2. Clause 2: -1 -3 5 0
This means that at least one of variables 1, 3 must be false, or variable 5 must be true.

3. Clause 3: -1 -3 4 0
This means that at least one of variables 1, 3 must be false, or variable 4 must be true.

4. Clause 4: -2 -4 5 0
This means that at least one of variables 2, 4 must be false, or variable 5 must be true.

5. Clause 5: -1 5 -3 0
This means that either variable 1 is false or variable 5 is true and variable 3 is false.

6. Clause 6: -4 -2 5 0
This means that at least one of variables 2, 4 must be false, or variable 5 must be true.

7. Clause 7: -3 -1 -2 0
This means that at least one of variables 1, 2, or 3 must be false.

8. Clause 8: 5 -3 -4 0
This means that either variable 5 is true and variables 3, 4 are false.

9. Clause 9: -3 -1 -4 0
This means that at least one of variables 1, 3, or 4 must be false.

10. Clause 10: 2 -4 -5 0
This means that either variable 2 is true, or variables 4, 5 are false.

11. Clause 11: 5 -3 -2 0
This means that either variable 5 is true, or variables 3, 2 are false.

12. Clause 12: -3 -5 -4 0
This means that either variable 3 is false, or variables 5, 4 are false.

13. Clause 13: -3 -4 5 0
This means that either variable 3 is false, or variables 4, 5 are true.

14. Clause 14: -3 -2 -4 0
This means that at least one of variables 2, 3, 4 must be false.

Now we can try to find an assignment of true/false values to these variables that satisfies all the clauses. 

By analyzing the clauses, we can see that assigning the following values to the variables satisfies all the clauses:
1 = True
2 = False
3 = False
4 = True
5 = True

Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:
answer: 1 -2 -3 4 5
