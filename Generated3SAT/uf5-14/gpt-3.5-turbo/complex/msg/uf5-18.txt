To solve this SAT problem, we will first convert it into a system of equations. 

The DIMACS format given is:
p cnf 5 14
4 1 3 0
-1 -3 2 0
4 -1 3 0
2 -1 4 0
-4 2 5 0
4 2 5 0
-1 5 -3 0
3 -5 4 0
5 2 -1 0
1 3 2 0
-5 -2 4 0
1 5 3 0
2 4 3 0
5 3 2 0

We can see that there are 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and 14 clauses. We will now convert the clauses into a readable form:

(4 v 1 v 3)
(-1 v -3 v 2)
(4 v -1 v 3)
(2 v -1 v 4)
(-4 v 2 v 5)
(4 v 2 v 5)
(-1 v 5 v -3)
(3 v -5 v 4)
(5 v 2 v -1)
(1 v 3 v 2)
(-5 v -2 v 4)
(1 v 5 v 3)
(2 v 4 v 3)
(5 v 3 v 2)

Now, we will try to satisfy the given clauses. Let's assign values to the variables based on the clauses:

1 = T
2 = T
3 = T
4 = T
5 = T

Therefore, the solution that satisfies all the given clauses is:
1 = True
2 = True
3 = True
4 = True
5 = True

answer: 1=T, 2=T, 3=T, 4=T, 5=T
