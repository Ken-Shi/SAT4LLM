To solve this SAT problem, we will first convert the given DIMACS format into a more readable format:
-4 -1 -3
-1 -3 -4
1 -5 -2
2 3 -4
-5 -2 -1
3 -5 -2
-2 -3 -5
4 -2 -5
5 -3 -4
1 -3 -5
-4 -2 -3
-3 -4 -5
-2 -1 -4
-4 -2 -5

We will now proceed to solve this problem. 

Starting with clause 1, we see that at least one of {-4, -1, -3} must be true. Let's set -4 to true.

This then forces clause 7 to be true, where {-2, -3, -5} must be satisfied. To do so, let's set -2 to true.

From there, clause 12 is satisfied as well {-2, -1, -4} where we've already set -2 and -4 is true, so the only remaining variable is -1. 

Now, clause 2 must be satisfied. Again, -1 is already true so -3 must be true.

Clause 10 can be satisfied by setting 1 to true.

For clause 4, we need to set 2 to true.

Clause 5 can be satisfied by setting -5 to true.

Finally, clause 8 can be satisfied by setting 4 to true.

All the other clauses are already satisfied based on the assignments we made while satisfying the above clauses. 

So, the solution is: 
4, -1, 3, 2, -5

Therefore, 
answer: 4, -1, 3, 2, -5
