This algorithm works by recursively assigning truth values to variables and simplifying the clauses based on these assignments.\n\n1. We will start by considering the first clause: 2 3 1\n   a. We can assign true to variables 2, 3, and 1 to satisfy this clause.\n\n2. Next, we move on to the second clause: -5 -2 -3\n   a. We can assign true to variable 5 and false to variables 2 and 3 to satisfy this clause.\n\n3. Continuing in this manner, we analyze each clause and make assignments accordingly:\n   -1 -4 -5: Assign true to 1, 4, and 5\n   3 -5 2: Assign true to 3, 5, and 2\n   -5 -3 4: Assign true to 5, 3, and 4\n   2 -4 -3: Assign true to 2, 4, and 3\n   2 1 5: Already satisfied\n   -4 -5 1: Assign true to 4, 5, and false to 1\n   3 1 2: Already satisfied\n   -4 -5 -1: Assign true to 4, 5, and false to 1\n\n4. After resolving all the clauses, we have a satisfying assignment:\n   Variables:\n   1 -> true\n   2 -> true\n   3 -> true\n   4 -> true\n   5 -> true\n\nTherefore, the final answer for this SAT problem is:\nanswer: 1 1 1 1 1"
