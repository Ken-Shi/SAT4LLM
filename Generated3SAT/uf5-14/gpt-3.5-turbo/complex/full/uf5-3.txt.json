(2 5 1) - This clause can be satisfied by setting variables 2 and 5 to true, and 1 to false.\n2. (1 3 2) - This clause can be satisfied by setting variables 1, 3, and 2 to true.\n3. (5 2 1) - This clause can be satisfied by setting variables 5, 2, and 1 to true.\n4. (1 5 2) - This clause can be satisfied by setting variables 1, 5, and 2 to true.\n5. (2 3 4) - This clause can be satisfied by setting variables 2, 3, and 4 to true.\n6. (-2 1 5) - This clause can be satisfied by setting variables 2 and 1 to false, and 5 to true.\n7. (5 2 4) - This clause can be satisfied by setting variables 5, 2, and 4 to true.\n8. (2 1 -4) - This clause can be satisfied by setting variables 2 and 1 to true, and 4 to false.\n9. (5 3 4) - This clause can be satisfied by setting variables 5, 3, and 4 to true.\n10. (4 1 5) - This clause can be satisfied by setting variables 4, 1, and 5 to true.\n11. (2 -5 4) - This clause can be satisfied by setting variables 2 and 4 to true, and 5 to false.\n12. (3 1 5) - This clause can be satisfied by setting variables 3, 1, and 5 to true.\n13. (5 3 4) - This clause is a duplicate of clause 9.\n14. (2 -3 1) - This clause can be satisfied by setting variables 2 and 1 to true, and 3 to false.\n\nTherefore, a satisfying assignment for this SAT problem is:\n1 = true\n2 = true\n3 = false\n4 = true\n5 = true\n\nanswer: 1 1 -1 1 1"
