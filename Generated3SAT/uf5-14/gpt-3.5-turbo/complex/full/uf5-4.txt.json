Clause 1: -1 -2 -4 0\nThis means that at least one of variables 1, 2, or 4 must be false.\n\n2. Clause 2: -1 -3 5 0\nThis means that at least one of variables 1, 3 must be false, or variable 5 must be true.\n\n3. Clause 3: -1 -3 4 0\nThis means that at least one of variables 1, 3 must be false, or variable 4 must be true.\n\n4. Clause 4: -2 -4 5 0\nThis means that at least one of variables 2, 4 must be false, or variable 5 must be true.\n\n5. Clause 5: -1 5 -3 0\nThis means that either variable 1 is false or variable 5 is true and variable 3 is false.\n\n6. Clause 6: -4 -2 5 0\nThis means that at least one of variables 2, 4 must be false, or variable 5 must be true.\n\n7. Clause 7: -3 -1 -2 0\nThis means that at least one of variables 1, 2, or 3 must be false.\n\n8. Clause 8: 5 -3 -4 0\nThis means that either variable 5 is true and variables 3, 4 are false.\n\n9. Clause 9: -3 -1 -4 0\nThis means that at least one of variables 1, 3, or 4 must be false.\n\n10. Clause 10: 2 -4 -5 0\nThis means that either variable 2 is true, or variables 4, 5 are false.\n\n11. Clause 11: 5 -3 -2 0\nThis means that either variable 5 is true, or variables 3, 2 are false.\n\n12. Clause 12: -3 -5 -4 0\nThis means that either variable 3 is false, or variables 5, 4 are false.\n\n13. Clause 13: -3 -4 5 0\nThis means that either variable 3 is false, or variables 4, 5 are true.\n\n14. Clause 14: -3 -2 -4 0\nThis means that at least one of variables 2, 3, 4 must be false.\n\nNow we can try to find an assignment of true/false values to these variables that satisfies all the clauses. \n\nBy analyzing the clauses, we can see that assigning the following values to the variables satisfies all the clauses:\n1 = True\n2 = False\n3 = False\n4 = True\n5 = True\n\nTherefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:\nanswer: 1 -2 -3 4 5"
