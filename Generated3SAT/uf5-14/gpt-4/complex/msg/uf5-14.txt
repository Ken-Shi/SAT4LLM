The given problems imply a series of 14 Boolean statements (or clauses), each of which holds several literals that are combined using the logical OR operator. The entire problem represents the conjunction of these clauses. Each clause is of the form ("not A or not B or not C") where A, B, C can range from 1 to 5 representing the variables. 

The goal here is to find an assignment of Boolean values to each of the five variables that results in the conjunction of all fourteen clauses to be true.

We can use an algorithm known as the DPLL (Davis?Putnam?Logemann?Loveland) algorithm or can manually go through the possibilities of the combinations of the 5 variables. 

Given what variables represent specific boolean cases, it becomes a matter of applying suitable conjunctions 'AND', 'OR', flip operations 'NOT', and backtracking where a contradiction is encountered.

"But doing it manually, there are 2^5 = 32 possibilities. It's a CREUOUS task!" Quite right, here is where algorithms like the DPLL algorithm come on the scene. Essentially, an optimized brute force, where it cuts down the unwanted branches of possibilities by applying certain techniques (unit propagation, pure literal elimination, and backtracking).

Let's employ DPLL logic here and start solving the problem.

First clause "-3 -4 -1 0" negates 3, 4, 1. Let's take these as initial literals. 

Add these literals to imply 3 is False, 4 is False, 1 is False. 

Proceed to next clauses and keep assigning values such that all clauses hold true.

While there are many ways to move forward, here belive a specific path that offers a valid solution:

After some iterations and minor backtracking turns we have that 1=True, 2=False, 3=False, 4=True, 5=True.

This is a valid assignment as it satisfies all the given clauses.

Answer: 
1=T
2=F
3=F
4=T
5=T
