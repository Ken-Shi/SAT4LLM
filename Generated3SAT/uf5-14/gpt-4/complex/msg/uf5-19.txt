This SAT (Satisfiability Problem) is represented in DIMACS format, which is a standard for specifying such problems. Further, this is a 3-SAT problem, which means that each clause, shown as lines in the provided format, consists of exactly 3 literals (variables or their negations).

Usually the 3-SAT problem is NP-complete, meaning the time complexity to solve 3-SAT grows exponentially with input size and there would likely be no straightforward way to predict which literals should be true to make all clauses true. However, for this problem, I'll try to analyze it and find an optimal solution using the iterative approach if there is short circuit.

- Start by assigning a 'false' value to all variables (1-5).
- Read clauses from top to bottom.
- -3 -5 1 0. to make clause true, assign 1='true'
- -5 2 -4 0. since 1 is already 'true', this clause is true.
- -2 -3 1 0. since 1 is already 'true', this clause is true.
- -5 1 -2 0. since 1 is already 'true', this clause is true
- -2 -3 -5 0. assign 2='true' to make clause true
- -3 4 -2 0. since 2 is already 'true', this clause is true
- 1 -5 -3 0. since 1 is already 'true', this clause is true
- 2 -5 -4 0. since 2 is already 'true', this clause is true
- 4 1 5 0. since 1 is already 'true', this clause is true
- 5 -4 -2 0. since 2 is already 'true', this clause is true
- 2 -5 -4 0. since 2 is already 'true', this clause is true
- -4 -5 -3 0. assign 4='true' to make clause true
- -2 -4 -3 0. since 2 and 4 are already 'true', this clause is true
- -3 1 -5 0. since 1 is already 'true', this clause is true

All clauses are true. Therefore, this assignment is a solution to the given SAT problem.

Answer: 1=True, 2=True, 3=False, 4=True, 5=False
