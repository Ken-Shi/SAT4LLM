This problem represents a propositional logic problem encoded in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). Each line after the first is a disjunction of literals (a clause), and the entire problem is the conjunction of these clauses. 0 user for termination per clause. A literal represents a variable or the negation of a variable, and these variables can be set to either true (1) or false (0).

To solve this, a typical approach is to use a SAT solver which implements the DPLL algorithm (Davis?Putnam?Logemann?Loveland algorithm) or a more powerful BCP algorithm (Boolean Constraint Propagation). However, by inspecting the clauses, we can try and derive a solution more manually.

Firstly, notice that every clause containing '5' also contains '4' ,values either '1' or '-3', meaning that the literal '5' can always be made false, without causing any clause to be false.

Secondly, either '1' or '-1' is present in every clause, and '1' occurs most frequently, implying a good chance that setting '1' to true will satisfy most clauses.

Here, some solution can be 1=true, and 2,3,4,5=false . Checking through the clauses, we find that indeed, this satisfies all of them. Let's denote false as '-1' and true as '1'.

Answer: '1 2 -1 3 -1 4 -1 5 -1'.
