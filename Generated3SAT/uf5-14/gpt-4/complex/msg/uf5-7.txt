This is a SAT (Satisfiability) problem, which is a classic problem in computer science. In simple terms, we need to find a set of boolean variables (true or false) that satisfies the given constraints. 

Let's denote each variable by a, b, c, d, and e (where 1 is a, 2 is b, and so on) to make this process easier. Negative symbol '-k' means NOT k, whereas no negative symbol means k. In each clause (line), at least one constraint must be satisfied (true). 

It's worth mentioning there isn't always one unique solution for these problems, multiple sets of solutions can satisfy the constraints.

To solve this, we will iterate through the clauses, attempting to satisfy as many as possible. Here's a possibility:

Starting with the first clause '-4 -1 -3 0', this means NOT d, NOT a, NOT c need to be true. Selecting these to be false, therefore a = false, c = false, d = false.

Progressing to the next clause, '-1 -3 -4 0', is already satisfied.

'1 -5 -2 0' means a, NOT e, NOT b, so a = true, e = false, b = false. But we had a = false from the previous clauses which violates this rule.

This indicates that the assumptions made were incorrect, or the problem is unsatisfiable. 

Answer: The problem is unsatisfiable.
