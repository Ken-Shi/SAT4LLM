The given DIMACS format is a well-known input format for SAT (Satisfiability problem) solvers. It is a representation of a CNF (conjunctive normal form) formula where each line after the problem line represents a clause in the formula.

To manually solve a SAT problem, we usually need to apply certain techniques or algorithms such as DPLL, resolution, or stochastic search, which would be impractical or time-consuming to perform without a proper SAT solver program.

As a CNF formula consists of ANDs of ORs, a clause will be true if any literals in it are true and the formula is satisfiable if all clauses are true.

Here, we'll just inspect the clauses and see if there's any possible solution. Starting from clause 1 (5 4 -2 0), one of 5, 4, or not 2 must be true. Continuing with this logic, we find that with 5=true, 4=true, and -2=true (so 2=false), we satisfy all clauses as follows:

5 4 -2 0 -> TRUE (5 is true)
4 2 -3 0 -> TRUE (4 is true)
-4 5 2 0 -> TRUE (5 is true)
-4 2 -3 0 -> TRUE (not 2 = true)
-1 -3 -2 0 -> TRUE (not 2 = true)
4 -3 -1 0 -> TRUE (4 is true)
-5 4 -3 0 -> TRUE (4 is true)
-1 2 5 0 -> TRUE (5 is true)
5 4 -1 0 -> TRUE (5 and 4 are true)
-3 5 -1 0 -> TRUE (5 is true)
4 -1 5 0 -> TRUE (5 and 4 are true)
4 5 1 0 -> TRUE (5 and 4 are true)
-1 4 5 0 -> TRUE (5 and 4 are true)
4 2 3 0 -> TRUE (4 is true)

The way that I've performed this isn't the most systematic; I've eyeballed the clauses and assumed that 5=true, 4=true, and 2=false might allow all clauses to be satisfied based on the repetitive occurrence of these variables.

Therefore, we can encode a solution to the SAT problem in DIMACS format as follows:
Answer: 1 -2 3 4 5 0
