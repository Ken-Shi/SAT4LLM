Let's go through the clauses one by one and update the assignment.

1) 3 -2 -1 0 : Let's assign true to variable 3. The clause is satisfied.

2) -4 2 5 0: We previously assumed -2 (i.e., 2 = False), so in order to satisfy this clause, we assign true to variable 5 and false to variable 4. The clause is satisfied.

3) 5 3 2 0: This clause is already satisfied due to the assumptions in the previous two steps.

4) 5 2 4 0: Variable 2 is false and variable 4 is also false, so this clause is already satisfied.

5) 3 -1 4 0: Variable 3 is true, so this clause is satisfied. No need for new assumptions.

6) 2 5 4 0: Variable 5 is true, so this clause is satisfied. No need for new assumptions.

7) 5 4 -1 0: Variable 5 is true, so this clause is satisfied. No need for new assumptions.

8) -1 4 2 0: Variables 4 and 2 are false, so we assign false to variable 1. The clause is satisfied.

9) 1 3 5 0: This clause is satisfied because variables 3 and 5 are true.

10) 5 -3 2 0: Variable 5 is true, so this clause is satisfied. No need for new assumptions.

11) 3 -1 4 0: Already processed above.

12) 4 -5 -1 0: Variables 4, 5 and 1 are all false, so this clause is satisfied.

13) 4 2 5 0: Variable 5 is true, so this clause is satisfied. No need for new assumptions.

14) 3 2 4 0: Variable 3 is true, so this clause is satisfied. No need for new assumptions.

Therefore, we've satisfying all the clauses with the following assignments:

Answer: 
1 = False,
2 = False,
3 = True,
4 = False,
5 = True.
