                "content": "The problem you have given is provided in what is known as DIMACS (Conjunctive Normal Form) CNF format, which is used under the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). This problem is in fact NP complete, and one of the first algorithms developed for it was the DPLL (Davis\u2013Putnam\u2013Logemann\u2013Loveland) algorithm.\n\nLet's dive in.\nWe are given five variables-----1,2,3,4,5 and 14 clauses. \n\nIn the DIMACS Format, each digit in the clause refers to a variable and the sign refers to its true (positive) or false (negative) state. For example,  2 5 1 0 means (2 OR 5 OR 1) is true and -2 1 5 0 means (-2 OR 1 OR 5) is true i.e., 2 is false or 1 or 5 is true\n\nApplying DPLL algorithm:\n1. First, you might apply deterministic rules to simplify the formula until you\u2019re left with pure variables (i.e., are either all positive or all negative in the formula).\n2. If there's a unit clause (n), assign it such a way to make it true. If there's a -n, assign n such a way to make -n true. Here, we don't have any unit clauses.\n3. If there're no unit clauses, select (heuristically) a variable, assign it true/false, simplify the formula and go to 1.\n4. If contradiction is reached, backtrack.\n\nHere, you can see that in the 14th clause, variable -3 or 1 or 2 has to be true. Considering 1 to be false, and -3 and 2 to be true, we can satisfy this clause. If we set variable 1 to false and 3 to true, you can see that there's a contradiction as the 2nd clause no longer holds (as it has 1 and 2 both as true). So, the configuration must be -1, 2, -3. For the boolean satisfiability to hold, all the clauses must be true simultaneously.\n\nOn checking all clauses with this configuration, we find that this satisfies all the clauses, thus providing a solution to the SAT problem.\n\nAnswer: For this SAT problem, the single solution that satisfies all clauses is -1, 2, -3, -4, 5."
