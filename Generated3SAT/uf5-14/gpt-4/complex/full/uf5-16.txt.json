Each line after the first is a disjunction of literals (a clause), and the entire problem is the conjunction of these clauses. 0 user for termination per clause. A literal represents a variable or the negation of a variable, and these variables can be set to either true (1) or false (0).\n\nTo solve this, a typical approach is to use a SAT solver which implements the DPLL algorithm (Davis\u2013Putnam\u2013Logemann\u2013Loveland algorithm) or a more powerful BCP algorithm (Boolean Constraint Propagation). However, by inspecting the clauses, we can try and derive a solution more manually.\n\nFirstly, notice that every clause containing '5' also contains '4' ,values either '1' or '-3', meaning that the literal '5' can always be made false, without causing any clause to be false.\n\nSecondly, either '1' or '-1' is present in every clause, and '1' occurs most frequently, implying a good chance that setting '1' to true will satisfy most clauses.\n\nHere, some solution can be 1=true, and 2,3,4,5=false . Checking through the clauses, we find that indeed, this satisfies all of them. Let's denote false as '-1' and true as '1'.\n\nAnswer: '1 2 -1 3 -1 4 -1 5 -1'."
