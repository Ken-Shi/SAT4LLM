Start by taking the first clause (2 3 1 0) - which can be interpreted as (2 OR 3 OR 1) - and assuming the first literal is true. \n2. For the second clause (-5 -2 -3 0), since we assumed 2 is true, -2 is false. We still have -5 and -3 to see if they are false in other clauses.\n3. If we go through all the clauses, we will see that there are clauses in which 5 appears by itself or in a negated form (-5) suggesting that this variable might not be assigned a definite truth value. \n4. After evaluating the literal 5 in all the clauses, we can try the same with variable 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n5. Doing so, we get the following picture: 1, 2, 3, and 4 can all be true, while 5 can be false.\n\nThe process above is a very simplified form of DPLL(Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) algorithm, a complete, backtracking-based search algorithm for deciding the satisfiability of propositional logic formulae in conjunctive normal form.\n\nAnswer: {1=true, 2=true, 3=true, 4=true, 5=false}"
