                "content": "In SAT problems, each line describes a disjunction (an OR clause) and each number represents a proposition. The sign of each number determines if the proposition is positive or negative (true or false).\n\nIt can be useful to first look at shorter clauses, as these are often more limiting. Here, the shortest clause is \"-4 3 1 0\", meaning either -4 or 3 or 1 has to be true. Given that our variables are either true (1) or false (-1) we can take that -4 is true (or 4 is false). \n\nFollowing on from this, let's look at some clauses that involve 4 for potentially limiting consequences. For example, the clause \"1 -5 4 0\" would mean essentially \"1 -5\" after \"choosing\" -4, implying that either 1 must be true or 5 must be false. Let's choose 1 to be true, so we have 1 is true and 4 is false.\n\nFollowing the same method, the clause \"1 -4 2 0\" reduces to just \"2\", meaning 2 is also true. And for the clause \"2 -5 -4 0\", this reduces to \"-5\", giving 5 is false.\n\nNow let's check some other clauses with our current assignments. The clause \"-5 1 -4 0\" now reduces to nothing, which is okay since an empty disjunctive clause can still be true (as it stands for a tautology). The clause \"-5 -4 -3 0\" now reduces to \"-3\", so 3 is false.\n\nLastly, the clause \"5 -3 4 0\" is already satisfied by -3 or -5, and \"-2 4 1 0\" is satisfied by -4 or 1 or 2. \"-3 -4 -5 0\" is also true as one of its literals is already true. The same goes for all other clauses.\n\nAnswer: 1 True, 2 True, 3 False, 4 False, 5 False."
