                "content": "Firstly, let's understand the DIMACS format you presented. It is a way to write Description Logic problems in a standard way that different programs can understand.\n\nThe first line specifies that we have five variables (called literals in SAT, and they can be either true or false) and fourteen clauses (a clause is a disjunction of literals). \n\nThen, each clause is written on a new line. A positive number represents the corresponding variable, and a negative number represents the negation of the variable. Each line ends with a zero.\n\nHere are the clauses from the SAT problem:\n\n1) (x4 v x1 v x3)\n2) (~x1 v ~x3 v x2)\n3) (x4 v ~x1 v x3)\n4) (x2 v ~x1 v x4)\n5) (~x4 v x2 v x5)\n6) (x4 v x2 v x5)\n7) (~x1 v x5 v ~x3)\n8) (x3 v ~x5 v x4)\n9) (x5 v x2 v ~x1)\n10) (x1 v x3 v x2)\n11) (~x5 v ~x2 v x4)\n12) (x1 v x5 v x3)\n13) (x2 v x4 v x3)\n14) (x5 v x3 v x2)\n\nFrom the clauses, some simple truths can be surfaced:\n\nFrom clause 1), x4 must be true because there's no other negative appearance of x4 amongst the rest of the clauses. This also resolves clause 3, 6, 8, 13.\n\nWith x4 being true, from clause 5, x2 must also be true in order to satisfy the clause. This also resolves clause 4, 9, 14.\n\nThen if we check clause 2, it is automatically satisfied because x2 is true.\n\nFollowing up in clause 7, it indicates ~x1 v x5 v ~x3. Since x1 and x3 don't otherwise appear in a negative clause, we can make both the negations false, which means x1 and x3 are true. This also resolves clause 10, and 12.\n\nFrom clauses 11 we can see that x5 is true because as x4 and x2 are true then ~x5 can't be true.\n\nSo, summarising, the values are: x1 = True, x2 = True, x3 = True, x4 = True, x5 = True.\n\nAnswer: 1 2 3 4 5"
