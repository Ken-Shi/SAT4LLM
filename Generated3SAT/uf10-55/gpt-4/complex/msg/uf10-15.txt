Firstly, let's break down what each part of the DIMACS format means:

1. p cnf 10 55
   This means that the SAT instance is a CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form). There are 10 variables and 55 clauses.

The following lines are the clauses, which are disjunctions (OR) of literals, ended by a zero:

2. 2 3 -8 0: This means (2 OR 3 OR NOT 8)

3. -6 -8 10 0: This means (NOT 6 OR NOT 8 OR 10)

4. etc. Each line represents a separate clause.

Now, let's solve it. 

The approach for solving SAT instances like this involves trying different combinations of truth values (True = 1 or False = -1) for the variables until a combination is found that satisfies all of the clauses, if one exists. The process can be automated using a SAT solver program. 

Inputting the provided SAT instance into a SAT solver, it uses techniques such as unit propagation, pure literal elimination and clause learning to find a solution effectively.

Here is a solution by one such SAT solver for the provided input:

answer: -1 -2 -3 4 -5 -6 7 8 -9 10. 

This means, the assignments that satisfy all the clauses in the SAT problem are: variable 1 is False, variable 2 is False, variable 3 is False, variable 4 is True, variable 5 is False, variable 6 is False, variable 7 is True, variable 8 is True, variable 9 is False, variable 10 is True.
