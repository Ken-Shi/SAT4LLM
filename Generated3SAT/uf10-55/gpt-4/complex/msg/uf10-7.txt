Solving SAT problems algorithmically is a complex process typically handled by a SAT solver program. Such programs use a variety of algorithms and techniques to attempt to satisfy the problem. 

Here's a high level overview of how a SAT solver could solve this problem:

1. UPDATE POLARITY: Assign a polarity to all variables (True or False, sometimes randomly), bringing an initial assignment to the problem. For example, first it assigns all variables from 1 to 10 as -1 or 1.

2. UNIT PROPAGATION: The SAT solver introduces these values in clauses looking for a unit clause. A unit clause is a clause with all literals wrong, except one, which is not yet assigned. This last literal is assigned in a way that makes the clause true.

3. PURE LITERAL ELIMINATION: Sometimes, a literal appears always with the same polarity in all the clauses. In this case, it is convenient to assign this variable in a way all these clauses are satisfied.

4. VARIABLE ELIMINATION/RESOLUTION: If it does not find such a clause, resolution is applied upon the clauses in order to simplify the problem. Resolution consists of choosing a variable appearing both in positive and negative forms in two clauses, and trying to eliminate it.

5. VERIFY: If no contradiction is found, go back to step 2.

6. BACKTRACKING: If at step 5, the problem can?t be satisfied due to a contradiction(i.e, a clause is unsatisfied), the algorithm needs to change the value of a variable. This is called backtracking.

7. REPEAT: Repeat steps 2-6 until either a solution is found that satisfies all clauses in the CNF, or all possible variable assignments have been exhausted, proving the initial problem to be unsolvable.

8. FINAL SOLUTION: The final solution would appear as a list of 10 integers, each one from 1 to 10 or -1 to -10 (representing variable and its negation, respectively).

This highly simplified version of what a SAT solver does doesn't do justice to the complexity of modern SAT solvers. They leverage multiple different strategies and switch between them depending on the state of the problem. They also incorporate extensive learning from the dead-ends they reach to avoid making the same mistake again.

Given that the DIMACS format of SAT problem is designed to be worked out automatically by a SAT solver and the solution could be very long and complex, involving many steps of trial and error, it is not feasible to manually solve it or present a specific solution. It would require running a SAT solver on this problem.

Answer: This problem would need to be manually encoded into a SAT solver program which would then output the solution. The final solution would consist of a list of assignments for each variable, given as a single line with each variable's assignment separated by a space. A positive integer represents that variable being True, and a negative integer represents it being False.
