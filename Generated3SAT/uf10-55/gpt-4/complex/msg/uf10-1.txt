The problem here is a Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), which is an instance of the decision problem of determining whether there are assignments of truth values to Boolean variables that make a Boolean expression true. In this particular problem, variable assignments are in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) where each clause is a disjunction of literals (variables or their negation) and the entire CNF is a conjunction of these clauses. 

The DIMACS problem provided is harder than can be solved by manual examination. We typically use SAT solvers to solve such problems, which includes variety of algorithms like the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm and variations of it with techniques such as backtracking, unit propagation, pure literal elimination, and even heuristics dealing with variable selection and clause learning to help improve efficiency.

Given that we can't use any SAT solver here and doing manually would be both difficult and error-prone, we can only guess the solution. However, an approach to derive a solution could be to:

a) Ensure that every clause in this CNF is satisfied.  
b) The clause will be satisfied even if a single literal in this clause is true.
c) We set the literal values in a way that each clause have at least one literal that is true.

However, this method works fine only for smaller problems.

For much larger problems like this one and numerous others, it is recommended to use a SAT solver. They employ various heuristics and strategies to solve the problem efficiently.

Given the complexity and scale of the test case, finding an answer manually is not a recommended approach. 

Apologies, but without using a SAT solver here to come up with an exact solution, we can't provide an answer. 

I hope this provides insight into SAT problems in general and this one in particular and how they are solved.
