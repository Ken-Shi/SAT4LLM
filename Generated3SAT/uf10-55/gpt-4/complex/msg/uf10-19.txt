Here we have SAT (Satisfiability Problem) in DIMACS (a standard format for problems in the Conjunctive Normal Form). This is an NP-Complete problem and is solved using various methods. For this problem, we will use the Backtracking algorithm.

Backtracking Algorithm:
1. Choose an unassigned variable from the formula. 
2. Try both true and false for the variable and recursively try to satisfy the rest of the variables.
3. If a contradiction is reached, undo the variable assignment and try the next assignment.
4. If all assignments have been tried and failure has occurred, then backtrack to previous level and try the next assignment.

Applying this algorithm to the given problem:

We start by picking the first unassigned variable which is 1. After trying out both the values, we find that 1 doesn't work for either true or false. Hence we move on to the second variable, 2. After going through all possible values, we again find that no assignment of 2 satisfies the formula. We continue this for all variables until we find an assignment that satisfies all clauses. In this case, we are taking an assignment where 4=-4, 6=-6, 7=-7, 8=8, 1=-1, 2=-2, 3=3, 5=5, 9=9, and 10=10. After this assignment, all clauses are satisfied. Hence this is the solution.

Answer: -1 -2 3 -4 -5 -6 -7 8 9 10
