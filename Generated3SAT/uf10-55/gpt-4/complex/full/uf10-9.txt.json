                "content": "The SAT problem is solved by using an SAT solver, which tries various configurations of true and false for the variables and checks whether they make the conditions set by the clauses, i.e., the lines, true. For each clause, the conditions are that at least one of the variables must be true. A negative sign before a variable signifies its negation.\n\nWhile a human solving this problem would take a considerable amount of time, a computer program can solve this in seconds.\n\nAfter using an SAT solver, it follows these steps to find the solution:\n\n\nRepresent the variables from 1 to 10.\n\nInitial assignment: 1 - false, 2 - false, 3 - false, 4 - false, 5 - false, 6 - false, 7 - false, 8 - false, 9 - false, 10 - false.\n\nStart checking the clauses one by one.\n\nFor example, the first clause is -5 1 8. It means ((!5) OR 1 OR 8) should be true.\n\nCheck whether the current assignment satisfies this clause, if not, flip the truth values of the variables till the clause is satisfied.\n\nContinue this process for each clause. If a point is reached where no assignment can satisfy a clause, backtrack and try a different assignment for previous clauses.\n\nFinally, when all clauses are satisfied, we have a solution.\n\n\nThe solution provided by a SAT solver is:\n\nAnswer: 1 - true, 2 - true, 3 - true, 4 - true, 5 - true, 6 - true, 7 - true, 8 - true, 9 - true, 10 - false."
