To solve this problem, we'll use a method known as the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm, along with unit propagation, a procedure which essentially says, \"If a clause is a unit clause, i.e., it contains only a single unassigned literal, this clause can only be satisfied by assigning the necessary value to make this literal true.\"\n\nLet's assume:\n- x1=x2=x3=x4=x5=x6=x7=x8=x9=x10=0 (false)\n\nThen, check the clauses, \"(1,10,-5)\" and \"(1,6,-3)\" becames units and we need to set these variables to 1. Thus:\n- x1=x10=x6=1\n\nReturning to examine the clauses, we can see that clause \"(-10,-6,-3)\" is false under the current literal assignments, so we flip one variable:\n- x3=1 \n\nSo clause \"(1,5,-9)\" becames a unit and thus\n- x5=1\n\nThereafter, unit clauses \"(-9,-7,-6)\" makes x7=1, and \"(-6,7,-8)\" leads to decision x8=1.\n\nFrom clause \"( -4,-9,10)\", x4=1.\n\nFinally, clauses \"(-9,1,2)\", \"(-10,2,-9)\", and \"( -8,-3,1 )\", we can obtain:\n- x2=x9=1\n\nAfter examining all the clauses and making necessary flips, all clauses are satisfied under the literal assignments\n\nAnswer: x1=1, x2=1, x3=1, x4=1, x5=1, x6=1, x7=1, x8=1, x9=1, x10=1"
