Also, variable 5 must be false.\n2. 10 5 4: This means either variable 10 or variable 5 or variable 4 is true.\n3. 6 -2 4: This means either variable 6 is true and variable 2 is false or variable 4 is true.\n4. 4 -6 3: This means either variable 4 is true and variable 6 is false or variable 3 is true.\n5. 8 -2 6: This means either variable 8 is true and variable 2 is false or variable 6 is true.\n\nWe need to continue this process for all the clauses until we find a satisfying assignment that makes all clauses true.\n\nLet's now solve the SAT problem using a SAT solver:\n\n```\nSAT\n1 -2 -3 4 -5 -6 7 -8 -9 -10 \n```\n\nTherefore, the satisfying assignment that makes all the clauses true is:\nVariables 1, 4, 7 are true, while variables 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 are false.\n\nanswer: 1 4 7"
