Also, the negation (NOT) of a variable flips its truth value.\n\nNow, if we consider an initial assignment of truth values such as 1=True, 2=False, 3=True:\n\nThe 1st clause is satisfied with 1=True OR 3=True OR NOT 2=NOT False=True (i.e., at least one variable is true).\nThe 2nd clause is satisfied with the same logic.\nThe 3rd clause is again satisfied with the same logic.\nThe 4th clause is satisfied with 3=True OR NOT 2=True OR 1=True.\nThe 5th clause is satisfied with NOT 2=True OR 1=True OR 3=True.\n\nTherefore, we've found an assignment of the variables that satisfies all of the clauses. This is clearly a satisfying assignment, and we could stop at this point as the problem is a decision problem: Is there a satisfying assignment? Yes, there is.\n\nThis is just one of the possible solutions. The solution isn't unique and could be determined based on how one proceeds with trying to find the solution. For instance, one might start from different truth assignments leading to a different valid solution since this is a satisfiability problem, not an optimization problem.\n\nAnswer: {1=True, 2=False, 3=True}"
