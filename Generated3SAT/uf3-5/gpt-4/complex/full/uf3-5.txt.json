                "content": "This is a 3-Satisfiable (3-SAT) problem. The 3-SAT problem is an NP-complete problem that is central to computational complexity theory. It basically consists of variables and clauses, and we want to find a truth assignment to the variables that satisfies all clauses. \n\nIn our problem, the first line denotes that we have 3 variables and 5 clauses.\n\nGiven the DIMACS format, we can decode the formula clauses as;\n\n1. (-X1 V X3 V -X2)\n2. (-X1 V -X3 V X2)\n3. (-X2 V -X1 V X3)\n4. (X3 V -X2 V -X1)\n5. (-X2 V -X1 V X3)\n\nHere, Xn denotes variables, V denotes OR, - denotes NOT, numbers denote the variable number and 0 indicates end of the clause.\n\nWe can directly begin to solve this problem by the method of assigning the variables one by one until we satisfy all clauses or in a more multi-threading manner, we can use the DPLL algorithm which is essentially a depth-first search of the space of partial assignments.\n\nFor this problem, we can have multiple correct answers, let's choose one of them.\n\n1. Assign X1=F\nThis makes clause 1 and 2 TRUE as -X1 becomes True.\n\n2. Assign X2=F\nThis makes Clause 3, 4, and 5 TRUE as -X2 becomes True.\n\nNow, all clauses are satisfied. Regardless of the value we choose for X3 (Either True or False), all clauses would still be satisfied. \n\nAnswer: X1=False, X2=False, X3=True(or False)\n\nIt is worthwhile to note that this is not the only correct solution. The 3-SAT is often a multivariate problem with multiple solutions."
