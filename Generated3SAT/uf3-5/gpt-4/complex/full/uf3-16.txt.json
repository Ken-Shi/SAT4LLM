                "content": "Before we move forward, let me clarify what the DIMACS format is. It's a standardized text format for defining SAT (Satisfiability Testing) problems in terms of clauses. Here, each clause is a disjunction of literals and the entire problem is a conjunction of these clauses. The literals can either be variables or their negations.\n\nIn the example:\n\n**p cnf 3 5** means that in boolean satisfiability problem, there are 3 variables and 5 clauses.\n\nAnd each clause is represented by the following lines:\n\n- **-2 -3 -1 0** represents the clause (-2) V (-3) V (-1)\n- **-3 -1 2 0** represents the clause (-3) V (-1) V 2\n- **-2 3 -1 0** represents the clause (-2) V 3 V (-1)\n- **-1 -2 -3 0** represents the clause (-1) V (-2) V (-3)\n- **-3 1 -2 0** represents the clause (-3) V 1 V (-2)\n\nThe clauses must be satisfied such that each clause has at least one True literal to make the whole clause True.\n\nNow let's try to solve the SAT problem:\n\nWe can see that most clauses, including the first and last, have -2. Therefore, the sensible choice is to assign 2=false. \n\nNow let's update the clauses with the assigned value:\n\n- (-2) V (-3) V (-1) => true V (-3) V (-1) => True\n- (-3) V (-1) V 2 => (-3) V (-1) V false => (-3) V (-1) => Not combinable\n- (-2) V 3 V (-1) => true V 3 V (-1) => True\n- (-1) V (-2) V (-3) => (-1) V true V (-3) => True\n- (-3) V 1 V (-2) => (-3) V 1 V true => True\n\nFrom here, we can see that except for the 2nd clause, all others become True with 2=false.\n\nIn clause 2 we choose to make -1 = true so we get:\n\n- (-3) V (-1) => (-3) V true => True\n\nSo all clauses can be made True by making 2=false, and 1=true. \n\nBy default, for 3, just choose a random value, let's say false.\n\n**Answer: 1=true, 2=false, 3=false**"
