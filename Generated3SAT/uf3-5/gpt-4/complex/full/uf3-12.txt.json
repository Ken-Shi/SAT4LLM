                "content": "To solve this task, we will use the notion of satisfied clauses in propositional logic. If a clause contains a positive variable, then assigning true to that variable will make the clause true. If a clause contains a negative variable, assigning false to that variable will make the clause true, given that the other literals (variables or their negation) in that clause do not force the clause to be false.\n\nOkay, let's start solving and analysing each clause one by one, we have total five clauses:\n\n- The first clause, -2 -1 3 0, becomes true when we assign false to either variable 2 or 1, or true to variable 3. Let's consider 3 to be true, so it doesn't conflict with any future assignments. \n\n- The second clause, -3 -1 -2 0, becomes true when we assign false to any of the three variables. But since we have already assigned true to 3 in the first clause, neither 3 nor 1 can be false. Continuing in this manner, we must assign false to 2 to satisfy the second clause.\n\n- The third clause, -2 1 -3 0, is already true since variable 2 is false.\n\n- The fourth clause, 1 2 -3 0, is already true since variable 2 is false.\n\n- The fifth clause, -2 -3 -1 0, becomes true when at least one variable between 2, 3 and 1 is false. We already have 2 which is false and hence the fifth clause is true.\n\nWe can see that the setting of variable 1 does not affect the truth of any clause.\n\nSo, we have a satisfying assignment: we can pick true for variable 3, false for variable 2 and either true or false for variable 1.\n\nanswer: 1 -2 3"
