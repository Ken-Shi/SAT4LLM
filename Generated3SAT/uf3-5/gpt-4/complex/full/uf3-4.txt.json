                "content": "The problem is written in CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form), which is a conjunction (AND) of one or more clauses, where a clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals. Plus, the problem follows the DIMACS format which is a standard for representing these types of problems in text files for usage by SAT solvers.\n\nLet's parse the problem:\np cnf 3 5 : It means that there are 3 variables and 5 clauses in the problem.\n\nThe five clauses are:\n1. 1 OR 2 OR NOT 3\n2. NOT 3 OR 2 OR 1\n3. NOT 3 OR 1 OR 2\n4. NOT 3 OR 1 OR 2\n5. 1 OR 2 OR NOT 3\n\nThe goal here is to assign truth values to the variables in such a way that every clause is true.\n\nLet's take an iterative approach by assigning T/F to variables and checking the validity of the clauses.\n\nFirst, let's choose 1=true, 2=true and 3=false:\n\nClause 1: 1 OR 2 OR NOT 3     => true OR true OR true = true\nClause 2: NOT 3 OR 2 OR 1     => true OR true OR true = true\nClause 3: NOT 3 OR 1 OR 2     => true OR true OR true = true\nClause 4: NOT 3 OR 1 OR 2     => true OR true OR true = true\nClause 5: 1 OR 2 OR NOT 3     => true OR true OR true = true\n\nThis assignment satisfies all the clauses. Therefore, this assignment is a solution for the given problem.\n\nAnswer: 1=true, 2=true, 3=false"
