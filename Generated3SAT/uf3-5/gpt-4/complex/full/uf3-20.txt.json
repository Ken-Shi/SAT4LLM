                "content": "The DIMACS CNF format is a way of encoding Boolean expressions (expressed in conjunctive normal form) for use with various algorithms that requires SAT-Solving techniques.\n\nHere we see there are 3 variables and 5 clauses.\n\nTake a look at first 2 clauses:\n-2 -1 3 0\n-2 -1 -3 0\n\nFirst clause says (-2 OR -1 OR 3) and the second (-2 OR -1 OR -3) should be true (0 in this format is the end of clause marker). \n\nLooking at these two clauses you can see that both will be satisfied if -1 is true (-1 equivalent is literal 1 being false). Also, we have enough information now to satisfy this SAT problem (without looking at the rest of the clauses) because the literals 2 and 3 are only dependent on literal 1 to be false.\n\nBut let's validate above assumption by looking at the remaining clauses:\n\nThird clause: [-3, -1, 2] can be read as (not 3 or not 1 or 2). This is true if -1 is true.\n\nFourth clause: [-2, 3, -1] can be read as (not 2 or 3 or not 1). This is true if -1 is true.\n\nFifth clause: [-3, -1, -2] can be read as (not 3 or not 1 or not 2). This is true if -1 is true.\n\nWe would still need to look at other clauses and consider multiple possible combinations in a more complex problem, but in this case, setting the variable 1 to false (or -1 to true) makes all the clauses true. \n\nAnswer: {1=False, 2=Free, 3=Free}"
