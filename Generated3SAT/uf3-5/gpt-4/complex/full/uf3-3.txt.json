                "content": "In order to solve a SAT (Satisfiability) problem, we need to assign the variables in a way that fulfills all the clauses. In DIMACS format, each clause is on a line ending in '0', positive integers denote variables, and the negative sign denotes the negation of a variable. \n\nHere, we have three variables (1, 2, 3) and five clauses: \n\nThe given clauses in words will look as follows:\n\n1. Either 3 is true, or 1 is true, or not-2 is true.\n2. Either not-2 is true, or 3 is true, or 1 is true.\n3. Either not-2 is true, or not-3 is true, or 1 is true.\n4. Either 3 is true, or not-1 is true, or not-2 is true.\n5. Either 1 is true, or not-2 is true, or 3 is true.\n\nTo satisfy these clauses, we'll first look for the most consistent variable across the clauses; we see that \"3\" or \"not-2\" appear in multiple clauses, and many are in a positive form.\n\nSetting 3 = True and 2 = False appears to have a wider impact on satisfying the clauses. Let's try that.\n\n1. The first clause is now true because 3 is true.\n2. The second clause is now true because not-2 is true (as 2 is False).\n3. The third clause is now true because not-2 is true (as 2 is False).\n4. The fourth clause is now true because 3 is true.\n5. The fifth clause is now true because not-2 is true (as 2 is False).\n\nYou can see that we have managed to satisfy all five clauses with this assignment, independent of the value of 1, so 1 can be assigned as either True or False.\n\nAnswer: 1=TRUE/FALSE, 2=FALSE, 3=TRUE"
