The problem consists of a set of clauses and the task is to find a truth assignment that makes all of the clauses true at the same time. In this case, the max number of variables is 3, i.e. the variables are [1, 2, 3]. There are 5 clauses in total. 

Line of Thoughts and Approach:
1. -2 1 -3 0: This clause means that if variable 2 is false OR variable 1 is true OR variable 3 is false, then this clause is true.
2. 2 -3 1 0: This clause means that if variable 2 is true OR variable 3 is false OR variable 1 is true, then this clause is true.
3. 2 -3 1 0: This clause means the same as the previous clause.
4. -3 1 2 0: This clause means that if variable 3 is false OR variable 1 is true OR variable 2 is true, then this clause is true.
5. -2 -3 1 0: This clause means that if variable 2 is false OR variable 3 is false OR variable 1 is true, then this clause is true.

Given these clauses, one possible assignment that makes all clauses true at the same is:
- 1: True (Since 3 out of 5 contains positive 1)
- 2: False (Since 2 out of 5 contains negative 2 and none contains negative 1)
- 3: False (Since 3 out of 5 contains negative 3 and none contains negative 2 or 1)

answer: 1=True, 2=False, 3=False
