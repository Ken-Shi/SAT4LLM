This is a SAT (satisfiability) problem, it's a classic problem in computational logic. Our task is to determine if there is an assignment of TRUE/FALSE values to variables (or propositions) 1, 2, and 3 such that all given clauses are satisfied (meaning, each clause has at least one TRUE literal). The format used here is DIMACS where every row after the p cnf line represents a clause. The number before "cnf" represents the total number of variables, the number after represents the total number of clauses. The number "0" is used to signify the end of a clause.

Let's break down the clauses and our steps in figuring this out:

1. Clause 1: 2 1 3 0 means if at least one of the variables 2, 1 or 3 is TRUE, then the clause is satisfied.
2. Clause 2: 1 3 2 0, this one is the same as the first clause but in different order, it's just redundant.
3. Clause 3: -3 1 2 0, this is a bit different. "-3" means the negation of 3. So 3 must be FALSE, or 1 or 2 must be TRUE for this clause to be satisfied.
4. Clause 4: Same as Clause 2, redundant.
5. Clause 5: 3 2 1 0, this is the same as the first clause, again redundant.

Since we have redundancies, we need satisfy only two distinct clauses. We could let variables 1 and 2 to be TRUE, then both Clause 1 and Clause 3 would be satisfied. That makes all clauses satisfied, as they are repetitions of those two clauses. Therefore, a solution exists.

Answer: 1 = TRUE, 2 = TRUE, 3 = FALSE
(Variables are often assumed to be FALSE unless they are assigned the value TRUE.)
