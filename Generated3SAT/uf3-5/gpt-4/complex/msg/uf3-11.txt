This problem is a Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) problem involving three variables (1, 2, 3) and five clauses. The DIMACS format is a standard format for representing CNF problems where each number represents a variable and a zero signifies the end of a clause. A negative number signifies the negation of that variable.

To solve this problem, we can use a method known as resolution. We can start by picking a literal and try to resolve all clauses that contain this literal either as positive or negative literal.

Consider clauses (2 1 3 0) and (3 1 -2 0), we can resolve them using 2. Upon doing this, we get the clause (3 1 0), which means either 3 or 1 is True.

Next, consider the equation (3 2 1 0) and the resolved clause (3 1 0), the result, (1 2 0), indicates that either 1 or 2 is True.

Now, when we take the clause (1 3 2 0) and the resolved clause (1 2 0), which clearly indicates 1 or 2 must be True.

Finally, we don't need to do anything with the last clause as it is exactly the same as the fourth clause.

Therefore, one possible solution to this SAT problem could be 1=True, 2=False, and 3=True.

Answer: 1=True, 2=False, 3=True.
