This is a SAT (Satisfiability) problem. Specifically, it's an instance of 3-SAT problem, which is a well-known NP-complete problem in computer science. 

The problem is given in DIMACS format, which is a standard format for specifying instances of propositional logic formulas (booleans expressions). 

Here is the formula separated into its individual clauses based on the DIMACS input:

1. (x3 OR x2 OR x1)
2. (x1 OR NOT x2 OR x3)
3. (NOT x3 OR NOT x2 OR x1)
4. (NOT x2 OR x3 OR x1)
5. (x1 OR x2 OR x3)

The goal of a SAT problem is to find a truth assignment for the variables that satisfies all of the clauses. A "0" at the end of a clause indicates the end of the clause. Polarities, which can be positive (indicating the variable itself) or negative (indicating the negation of the variable), are given by the signs of the numbers.

To solve this, you could take a guess-and-check strategy, systematically trying all possible combination of True / False values for x1, x2, x3 until you find one that makes all clauses True. 

- Check 1: x1=True, x2=True, x3=True satisfies all clauses.
- No further checking needed since a satisfying assignment has been found.

Answer: x1=True, x2=True, x3=True.
