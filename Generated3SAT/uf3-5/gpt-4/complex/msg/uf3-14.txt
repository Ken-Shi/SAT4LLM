To solve the provided SAT problem in DIMACS format, let's first understand what it represents. 

The given problem represents the conjunction of five clauses, each of which is a disjunction of three literals:

(-2 ? 3 ? 1)
(-2 ? 1 ? 3)
(3 ? -1 ? -2)
(1 ? -2 ? 3)
(1 ? 3 ? -2)

Negative literals are negations of the associated variables. For example, -2 is equivalent to the negation of variable 2.

There are various methods to solve this problem such as Backtracking, Branch and Bound, Heuristic methods etc. Here, we simply try assigning true or false to the variables in a way that satisfies all clauses.

Let's try assigning the values:

Variable 1: true
Variable 2: false
Variable 3: true

Now, let's substitute these variables in the clauses:

Clause 1: (-false ? true ? true) = true ? true ? true = true
Clause 2: (-false ? true ? true) = true ? true ? true  = true
Clause 3: (true ? -true ? -false) = true ? false ? true  = true
Clause 4: (true ? -false ? true) = true ? true ? true  = true
Clause 5: (true ? true ? -false) = true ? true ? true  = true

All clauses are satisfied (each clause evaluates to true), so these variable assignments are indeed a solution.

Answer: Variable 1: true, Variable 2: false, Variable 3: true
