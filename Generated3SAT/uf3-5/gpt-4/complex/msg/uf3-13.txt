This DIMACS CNF format represents a Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). Let's introduce some notations first. In this scenario, we have 3 variables and 5 clauses:

1. "-3 -1 -2 0" => (NOT x3) OR (NOT x1) OR (NOT x2)
2. "2 -3 -1 0" => x2 OR (NOT x3) OR (NOT x1)
3. "-3 1 -2 0" => (NOT x3) OR x1 OR (NOT x2)
4. "2 1 -3 0" => x2 OR x1 OR (NOT x3)
5. "-3 1 2 0" => (NOT x3) OR x1 OR x2

SAT problems are typically solved using backtracking, DPLL algorithms, stochastic local search or satisfiability solvers. But we can try to solve this by hand due to its simplicity.

Let's begin by setting x3 = False (due to its repetitive occurrence in a NOT state):

- Clauses 1, 3, and 5 are immediately satisfied.
- In the 2nd clause (x2 OR (NOT x3) OR (NOT x1)), we need either x2 or (NOT x1) to be True. Let's set x2 = True.
- This satisfies the 4th clause (x2 OR x1 OR (NOT x3)).
- For the 2nd clause (x2 OR (NOT x3) OR (NOT x1)) which is not satisfied yet, you can make x1 = False.

Answer: [False, True, False] for [x1, x2, x3] respectively.
