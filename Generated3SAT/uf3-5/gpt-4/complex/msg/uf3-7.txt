The problem given is a 3-SAT problem, which is an NP-complete problem in Boolean logic. The problem is encoded in DIMACS format, commonly used for describing instances of the boolean satisfiability problem, in the Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).

First, let's break down the problem. In the DIMACS notation, a negative number represents the negation of a variable and '0' marks the end of a clause. Here, we have 3 variables and 5 clauses as indicated by the first line "p cnf 3 5".

The clauses, in logical form, are given as follows:

1. Clause 1: (NOT variable 2) OR (NOT variable 3) OR (NOT variable 1)
2. Clause 2: (NOT variable 2) OR (NOT variable 1) OR (NOT variable 3)
3. Clause 3: (NOT variable 1) OR (NOT variable 2) OR (NOT variable 3)
4. Clause 4: (NOT variable 3) OR (NOT variable 2) OR (NOT variable 1)
5. Clause 5: variable 2 OR (NOT variable 3) OR (NOT variable 1)

We can immediately see that the first four clauses are the same, just the variables are in different orders. They all imply that at least one of the variables must be false because of the notation of the Not operator. The last clause might seem that variable 2 can be true but that would make clauses 1, 2, 3 and 4 unsatisfiable because variable 2 is false in those. So the only way all can be true is that variable 2 is false.

From the above analysis, the assignment for the 3 variables is: Variable 1 = False, Variable 2 = False and Variable 3 = False.

Answer: -1 -2 -3
