The given problem is a representation of a Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT problem). The input to the problem is a Boolean formula with clauses separated by line breaks. Each clause contains literals separated by spaces and ends with a '0'. A literal is either a variable or the negation of a variable. 

Each line represents a clause. A clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals. The problem as a whole represents the conjunction (AND) of all the clauses, hence the task is to assign truth values (true/false) to the variables such that the entire expression is true.

Following is the logical presentation of the input:

1: (1 OR NOT 2 OR NOT 3)
2: (NOT 2 OR 1 OR 3)
3: (NOT 2 OR NOT 3 OR 1)
4: (3 OR NOT 2 OR 1)
5: (NOT 3 OR NOT 2 OR 1)

Let's try to solve the problem.

Start by setting variable 1 to true (since it appears un-negated most frequently). This immediately satisfies clauses 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 

Now, we have to make sure that other variables doesn't set this solution as false. In each clause there is "-2", so let's set 2 to false. By doing this, we don't violate any conditions for the clauses.

And finally, to satisfy the rest of literals/clauses, we should set 3 to false.

So, a solution that satisfies all clauses is: 1=true, 2=false, 3=false.

Answer: 1 -2 -3
