The given problem is a SAT (Satisfiability Problem) problem represented in DIMACS format. Which seems to be a Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). This is a way of representing Boolean logic formulae that can be used as input for certain types of logic solvers, such as SAT solvers. There are 3 variables (represented by 1, 2 and 3) and 5 clauses.

The clauses are as follows:
1) Not of Variable 1 AND Not of Variable 2 AND Not of Variable 3
2) Not of Variable 1 AND Variable 3 AND Not of Variable 2
3) Not of Variable 1 AND Variable 2 AND Not of Variable 3
4) Not of Variable 2 AND Variable 1 AND Not of Variable 3
5) Not of Variable 3 AND Not of Variable 2 AND Not of Variable 1

One simple approach is to try all possible combinations of variables. A negative sign in front of a variable means negation (NOT). So, our task is to find an assignment of the variables that make all the clauses true.

If we try the possible assignments, we can find an assignment where all clauses are satisfied:
1 = False
2 = True
3 = False

Analyze the clauses with this assignment:
1) Not False AND Not True AND Not False = True AND False AND True = FALSE
2) Not False AND False AND Not True = True AND False AND True = FALSE
3) Not False AND True AND Not False = True AND True AND True = TRUE
4) Not True AND False AND Not False = False AND False AND True = FALSE
5) Not False AND Not True AND Not False = True AND False AND True = FALSE

This shows that there exists an assignment where at least one clause is false, which suggests that this problem has no solution that satisfies all the clauses simultaneously. 

Answer: There is no solution to this problem.
