The SAT (satisfiability) problem in this question is presented in the DIMACS (a standard format in computational problem solving) where each line represents a clause. The 'p cnf' line indicates that the problem is conjunctive normal form (it's a 'product of sums'), with 3 variables and 5 clauses.

Here, the interpretation of the clauses is as follows:
3 2 -1 0 => (x3 or x2 or not x1)
2 -1 -3 0 => (x2 or not x1 or not x3)
-1 2 3 0 => (not x1 or x2 or x3)

Now, we have to find a set of values for the variables that makes each clause ?true.? If such a set exists, we say the instance of the problem is satisfiable; if not, it?s unsatisfiable.

For an easy rule of thumb: a positive number represents the existence of a literal, and a negative number represents the negation of that literal. The zero (0) at the end of each line signifies the end of each clause.

The first clause (3 2 -1 0) tells us one of x3, x2, or not x1 has to be true. If we arbitrarily assign x1=false, x2=true and x3=true, that makes all clauses fulfilled, hence the whole condition becomes true, meaning this problem is satisfiable.

answer: x1=false, x2=true, x3=true.
