In this problem, we have 3 variables denoted as 1, 2, and 3, and 5 clauses. Each clause is a list of literals (variables or their negations), where a clause is true if at least one of its literals is true. A negative symbol in front of a literal denotes the negation of a variable.

The first step would be to try to interpret the clauses:

1. 2 -3 1 0: This translates to (2 OR not 3 OR 1), meaning either 2 or not 3 or 1 must be true.
2. -3 2 1 0: This translates to (not 3 OR 2 OR 1), meaning either not 3 or 2 or 1 must be true.
3. 2 1 -3 0: This translates to (2 OR 1 OR not 3), meaning either 2 or 1 or not 3 must be true.
4. -2 1 -3 0: This translates to (not 2 OR 1 OR not 3), meaning either not 2 or 1 or not 3 must be true.
5. -3 -2 1 0: This translates to (not 3 OR not 2 OR 1), meaning either not 3 or not 2 or 1 must be true.

Observing these statements, we can see that 1 appears in all the clauses without the negative symbol. This means that if we set 1 to true, all the clauses become true.

Answer: The solution is 1=True, 2=don't care, 3=don't care. Any assignments to 2 and 3 will satisfy the given clauses as long as 1 is true. In terms of the DIMACS format, we can simply state that 1 is positive: "1".
