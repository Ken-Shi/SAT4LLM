To solve the SAT problem given in the DIMACS format, one will need to find the variable assignments that make the whole formula true. 
The SAT problem can be translated into the boolean formula (not x3 or x2 or not x1) and (x3 or x2 or not x1) and (not x1 or x2 or not x3) and (not x1 or not x3 or x2) and (not x1 or not x3 or x2).

By analyzing the formula, I notice that the first two clauses contain the literals x1 and x2. Both x1 and x2 must be true to satisfy the remaining clauses. This can be stated as: 

If x1 and x2 are false, then both would not satisfy the remaining clauses containing -x1 and x2. We can infer that x1 and x2 must both be true, or x1=true and x2=true. 

This implies that x3 must be false in order to satisfy the original formula because x3=false (or -x3=true) would satisfy the first clause, the third clause, and the fourth clause.

Answer: x1=true, x2=true, x3=false.
