The problem provides a set of logical constraints for propositional variables. In this case, the variables are 1, 2, and 3, and we have 5 constraints (clauses). The constraints are interpreted as follows based on DIMACS format:

? -3 2 1 0: "(NOT 3) OR 2 OR 1"
? -3 2 -1 0: "(NOT 3) OR 2 OR (NOT 1)"
? -1 -3 2 0: "(NOT 1) OR (NOT 3) OR 2"
? 2 -3 -1 0: "2 OR (NOT 3) OR (NOT 1)"
? 2 1 3 0 : "2 OR 1 OR 3"

The task is to satisfy all of these at the same time. Let' go clause by clause. A variable "1" appears in a negative form in the 3rd and 4th clauses, and also in positive form in the 1st and last clauses. So let's set "1" as TRUE in the final answer to fulfill those 2 clauses. Variable "2" appears in positive form in the 4th clause and negative form doesn't exist. So we get "2" is TRUE in the final answer. Finally, for "3", it appears in negative form in the first, second, third and fourth clauses. Positive "3" appears in the last clause only. So we take it as FALSE based on majority. Therefore, when variable "1" and "2" are TRUE and "3" is FALSE, all the clauses are TRUE, so we get the final answer.

Answer: 1=TRUE, 2=TRUE, 3=FALSE
