Let's look at the task at hand, the problem is written in DIMACS format, typically used to define SAT (Satisfiability) problems.

This problem consists of 3 variables and 5 clauses.

Here's what the clauses look like translated:

(1 OR 3 OR NOT 2)
(1 OR NOT 2 OR 3)
(1 OR NOT 2 OR 3)
(3 OR NOT 2 OR 1)
(NOT 2 OR 1 OR 3)

First, we need to remember that the OR operation is satisfied if any of the elements are true. Also, the negation (NOT) of a variable flips its truth value.

Now, if we consider an initial assignment of truth values such as 1=True, 2=False, 3=True:

The 1st clause is satisfied with 1=True OR 3=True OR NOT 2=NOT False=True (i.e., at least one variable is true).
The 2nd clause is satisfied with the same logic.
The 3rd clause is again satisfied with the same logic.
The 4th clause is satisfied with 3=True OR NOT 2=True OR 1=True.
The 5th clause is satisfied with NOT 2=True OR 1=True OR 3=True.

Therefore, we've found an assignment of the variables that satisfies all of the clauses. This is clearly a satisfying assignment, and we could stop at this point as the problem is a decision problem: Is there a satisfying assignment? Yes, there is.

This is just one of the possible solutions. The solution isn't unique and could be determined based on how one proceeds with trying to find the solution. For instance, one might start from different truth assignments leading to a different valid solution since this is a satisfiability problem, not an optimization problem.

Answer: {1=True, 2=False, 3=True}
