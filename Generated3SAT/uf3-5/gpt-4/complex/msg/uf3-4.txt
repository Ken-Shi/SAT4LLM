The problem is written in CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form), which is a conjunction (AND) of one or more clauses, where a clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals. Plus, the problem follows the DIMACS format which is a standard for representing these types of problems in text files for usage by SAT solvers.

Let's parse the problem:
p cnf 3 5 : It means that there are 3 variables and 5 clauses in the problem.

The five clauses are:
1. 1 OR 2 OR NOT 3
2. NOT 3 OR 2 OR 1
3. NOT 3 OR 1 OR 2
4. NOT 3 OR 1 OR 2
5. 1 OR 2 OR NOT 3

The goal here is to assign truth values to the variables in such a way that every clause is true.

Let's take an iterative approach by assigning T/F to variables and checking the validity of the clauses.

First, let's choose 1=true, 2=true and 3=false:

Clause 1: 1 OR 2 OR NOT 3     => true OR true OR true = true
Clause 2: NOT 3 OR 2 OR 1     => true OR true OR true = true
Clause 3: NOT 3 OR 1 OR 2     => true OR true OR true = true
Clause 4: NOT 3 OR 1 OR 2     => true OR true OR true = true
Clause 5: 1 OR 2 OR NOT 3     => true OR true OR true = true

This assignment satisfies all the clauses. Therefore, this assignment is a solution for the given problem.

Answer: 1=true, 2=true, 3=false
