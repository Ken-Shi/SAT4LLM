The problem is in CNF format with 3 variables and 5 clauses.\n2. We have to find values for the variables (1, 2, 3) that satisfy all the clauses.\n\nStart solving:\n- For the first two lines:\n3 2 -1 0\n3 2 -1 0\nBoth of these lines mean that either 3 OR 2 OR -1 should be True.\nTo satisfy this, we can set variable 3 to True.\n\n- For the third line:\n2 -1 -3 0\nThis means either 2 OR -1 OR -3 should be True, since 3 has already been set to True, we can set -1 to True to satisfy this clause.\n\n- For the fourth line:\n-1 2 3 0\nThis means either -1 OR 2 OR 3 should be True, which is already satisfied by setting -1 and 3 to True earlier.\n\n- For the fifth line:\n3 2 -1 0\nThis clause is already satisfied by setting 3 and -1 to True earlier.\n\nFinal answer:\nanswer: 3 -1 -2"
