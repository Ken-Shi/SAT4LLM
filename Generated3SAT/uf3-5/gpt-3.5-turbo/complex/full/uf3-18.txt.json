To satisfy these clauses, variable 1 must be true. Thus, we can remove variable 1 from these clauses, simplifying them to:\n\nClause 1: (2 OR 3)\nClause 3: (NOT 3 OR 2)\nClause 5: (3 OR 2)\n\nNow, we see that for Clause 3 to be satisfied, variable 2 must be true. And for Clause 1 and 5 to be satisfied, variable 3 must be true. Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:\n\nanswer: 1 true, 2 true, 3 true"
