(2 OR -3 OR 1)\n2. (-3 OR 2 OR 1)\n3. (2 OR 1 OR -3)\n4. (-2 OR 1 OR -3)\n5. (-3 OR -2 OR 1)\n\nLet's analyze the clauses:\n\nFrom clause 1, either 2, -3, or 1 must be true.\nFrom clause 2, either -3, 2, or 1 must be true.\nFrom clause 3, either 2, 1, or -3 must be true.\nFrom clause 4, either -2, 1, or -3 must be true.\nFrom clause 5, either -3, -2, or 1 must be true.\n\nNow, let's try to find a truth assignment that satisfies all the clauses:\n\nLet's assume 2 is true. In that case, clause 1 is satisfied, and clause 3 is satisfied as well. However, to satisfy clause 4, -2 must be false, which means 2 must be false, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, 2 must be false.\n\nNow, let's assume 1 is true. In that case, clause 1 is satisfied, and clause 2 is satisfied as well. However, to satisfy clause 3, 2 must be false, which we already know. Therefore, 1 must be true.\n\nNow, let's check the assignments for 1 and -3. If 1 is true, then clause 1 and clause 2 are satisfied. For clause 3, -3 must be true. This satisfies all the clauses, and therefore, the truth assignment that satisfies all the clauses is:\n1 is true\n-3 is true\n2 is false\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nanswer: 1 -3 -2"
