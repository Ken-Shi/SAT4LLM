The problem has 3 variables and 5 clauses.\n\n- First clause: -2 -1 3 -> This can be satisfied by assigning true values to variables 2 and 1.\n- Second clause: -2 -1 -3 -> This can be satisfied by assigning true values to variables 2 and 1.\n- Third clause: -3 -1 2 -> This can be satisfied by assigning true values to variables 3 and 1.\n- Fourth clause: -2 3 -1 -> This can be satisfied by assigning true values to variables 2 and 3.\n- Fifth clause: -3 -1 -2 -> This can be satisfied by assigning true values to variables 3 and 1.\n\nTherefore, the clauses can be satisfied by assigning the following values to the variables:\n1 = true\n2 = true\n3 = true\n\nThis assignment satisfies all 5 clauses, therefore it is a solution to the SAT problem.\n\nAnswer: 1 = true, 2 = true, 3 = true"
