Clause 2: NOT x2 OR x1 OR x3\n3. Clause 3: x3 OR NOT x1 OR NOT x2\n4. Clause 4: x1 OR NOT x2 OR x3\n5. Clause 5: x1 OR x3 OR NOT x2\n\nTo find a satisfying assignment, we can start by trying different combinations of truth values for the variables.\n\n1. Let's set x1 = True, x2 = False, x3 = False:\n- Clause 1 is satisfied (True OR False OR False = True)\n- Clause 2 is satisfied (True OR False OR False = True)\n- Clause 3 is not satisfied (False OR True OR True = True)\n- Clause 4 is satisfied (True OR True OR False = True)\n- Clause 5 is not satisfied (True OR False OR True = True)\n\nSince there are no assignments that satisfy all clauses, the problem is unsatisfiable.\n\nanswer: unsatisfiable"
