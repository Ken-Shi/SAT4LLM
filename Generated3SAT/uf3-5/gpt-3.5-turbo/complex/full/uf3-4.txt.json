                "content": "To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will first analyze the clauses provided:\n\n1. 1 2 -3 0\n2. -3 2 1 0\n3. -3 1 2 0\n4. -3 1 2 0\n5. 1 2 -3 0\n\nWe can simplify the clauses as follows:\n- Clause 1: (1 OR 2 OR NOT 3)\n- Clause 2: (NOT 3 OR 2 OR 1)\n- Clause 3: (NOT 3 OR 1 OR 2)\n- Clause 4: (NOT 3 OR 1 OR 2)\n- Clause 5: (1 OR 2 OR NOT 3)\n\nNow, we can see that Clauses 3 and 4 are repeats, so we can simplify the problem further:\n- Clause 1: (1 OR 2 OR NOT 3)\n- Clause 2: (NOT 3 OR 2 OR 1)\n- Clause 3: (NOT 3 OR 1 OR 2)\n\nNext, we can see that Clauses 1 and 2 are complement of each other, so they can never be both true at the same time. Therefore, the only solution is when NOT 3 is true and 1 or 2 is true.\n\nHence, the final answer is: \nanswer: 3 1"
