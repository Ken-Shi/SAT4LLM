(-2 v -1 v 3)\n4. (3 v -2 v -1)\n5. (-2 v -1 v 3)\n\nWe need to find an assignment of variables that satisfies all of the clauses. Let's analyze each clause:\n- Clause 1: At least one of {-1, 3, -2} must be true. This clause is satisfied if -1 and 3 are true.\n- Clause 2: At least one of {-1, -3, 2} must be true. This clause is satisfied if -1 and -3 are true.\n- Clause 3: At least one of {-2, -1, 3} must be true. This clause is satisfied if -1 and 3 are true.\n- Clause 4: At least one of {3, -2, -1} must be true. This clause is satisfied if 3 and -2 are true.\n- Clause 5: At least one of {-2, -1, 3} must be true. This clause is satisfied if -1 and 3 are true.\n\nFrom analyzing the clauses, we find that -1 = True, 3 = True, and -2 = False satisfies all the clauses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nanswer: -1 3 -2"
