Each number represents a literal (either a variable or its negation), with '0' indicating the end of the clause. \n\nNow let's analyze the clauses:\n1. -2 -3 -1 0 -> This means that either variable 2 or 3 must be false in order for the clause to be satisfied. \n2. -2 -1 -3 0 -> Either variable 2 or variable 1 must be false. \n3. -1 -2 -3 0 -> Same as clause 2, either variable 1 or variable 2 must be false. \n4. -3 -2 -1 0 -> Either variable 3 or variable 2 must be false. \n5. 2 -3 -1 0 -> Variable 2 must be true. \n\nCombining all the clauses, we can see that the only way to satisfy all clauses is to make variable 2 true, and variables 1 and 3 false. \n\nTherefore, the solution is: \nanswer: 2=false, 1=false, 3=false"
