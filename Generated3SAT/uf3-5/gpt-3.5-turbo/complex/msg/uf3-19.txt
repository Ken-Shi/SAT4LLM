To solve this SAT problem, we can use the following approach:

1. Each line represents a clause in the CNF formula.
2. The numbers in each line represent the literals in the clause. Positive numbers represent variables, while negative numbers represent the negation of variables.
3. The numbers in each line are separated by spaces, and the line ends with a 0.

Now, let's interpret the given CNF formula:

p cnf 3 5
-1 -2 -3 0
-1 3 -2 0
-1 2 -3 0
-2 1 -3 0
-3 -2 -1 0

- The formula has 3 variables (1, 2, 3) and 5 clauses.
- The clauses are as follows:
  1. (-1 OR -2 OR -3)
  2. (-1 OR 3 OR -2)
  3. (-1 OR 2 OR -3)
  4. (-2 OR 1 OR -3)
  5. (-3 OR -2 OR -1)

Now, let's simplify the formula by finding the satisfying assignment for the formula:

1. We can see that the first, third, and fifth clauses cannot be simultaneously satisfied (since they involve mutually exclusive literals).
2. The second clause can be satisfied by assigning variables as follows: {-1, 3, -2}.
3. The fourth clause can be satisfied by assigning variables as follows: {-2, 1, -3}.

Therefore, the satisfying assignment for the formula is:
1. Variable 1 is false (-1)
2. Variable 2 is true (1)
3. Variable 3 is false (-3)

So, the solution to the SAT problem is:
answer: 1 -2 3
