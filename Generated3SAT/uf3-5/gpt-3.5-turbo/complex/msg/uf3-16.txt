First, let's decode the DIMACS format:
- There are 3 variables and 5 clauses in this problem.
- The clauses are as follows:
  1. -2 -3 -1
  2. -3 -1 2
  3. -2 3 -1
  4. -1 -2 -3
  5. -3 1 -2

Now, let's try to simplify the problem by analyzing the clauses:
- From clause 1, we can see that either variable 2 or variable 3 must be True in order for the clause to be True.
- From clause 2, we can see that either variable 3 or variable 2 must be True, and variable 1 must be False in order for the clause to be True.
- From clause 3, we can see that either variable 2 or variable 3 must be True, and variable 1 must be False in order for the clause to be True.
- From clause 4, we can see that either variable 1 or variable 2 must be True, and variable 3 must be False in order for the clause to be True.
- From clause 5, we can see that either variable 3 or variable 1 must be True, and variable 2 must be False in order for the clause to be True.

Combining all the information, we can see that variables 2, 3, and 1 must all be True simultaneously in order to satisfy all the clauses. So, the solution to this SAT problem is:
answer: 2 3 1
