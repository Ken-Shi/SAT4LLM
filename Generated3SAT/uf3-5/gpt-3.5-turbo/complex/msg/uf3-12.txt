To solve this SAT problem, we will convert the DIMACS format into a easier to understand format. 

The DIMACS format p cnf 3 5 specifies that there are 3 variables and 5 clauses. 

The clauses are as follows:
1. -2 -1 3
2. -3 -1 -2
3. -2 1 -3
4. 1 2 -3
5. -2 -3 -1

Now, we will try to solve this problem by trying different combinations of truth values for the variables.

Let's start with all variables set to True:
1. -2 -1 3 = -T - T + T = F
2. -3 -1 -2 = -T T - T = F 
3. -2 1 -3 = -T T - T = F
4. 1 2 -3 = T T - T = F
5. -2 -3 -1 = -T - T - T = F

Now, let's try all variables set to False:
1. -2 -1 3 = -F - F + F = T
2. -3 -1 -2 = -F - F - F = T
3. -2 1 -3 = -F + F - F = T
4. 1 2 -3 = F F - F = T
5. -2 -3 -1 = -F - F - F = T

Since there is at least one valid assignment (all variables False) that satisfies all clauses, the given SAT problem is satisfiable.

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: satisfiable
