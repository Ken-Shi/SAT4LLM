To solve this problem, we will first convert the given CNF formula in DIMACS format into a more readable form:

Clauses:
1. (-1 v 3 v -2)
2. (-1 v -3 v 2)
3. (-2 v -1 v 3)
4. (3 v -2 v -1)
5. (-2 v -1 v 3)

We need to find an assignment of variables that satisfies all of the clauses. Let's analyze each clause:
- Clause 1: At least one of {-1, 3, -2} must be true. This clause is satisfied if -1 and 3 are true.
- Clause 2: At least one of {-1, -3, 2} must be true. This clause is satisfied if -1 and -3 are true.
- Clause 3: At least one of {-2, -1, 3} must be true. This clause is satisfied if -1 and 3 are true.
- Clause 4: At least one of {3, -2, -1} must be true. This clause is satisfied if 3 and -2 are true.
- Clause 5: At least one of {-2, -1, 3} must be true. This clause is satisfied if -1 and 3 are true.

From analyzing the clauses, we find that -1 = True, 3 = True, and -2 = False satisfies all the clauses.

Therefore, the final answer is:

answer: -1 3 -2
