Given the DIMACS formatted problem:
p cnf 3 5
3 2 -1 0
3 2 -1 0
2 -1 -3 0
-1 2 3 0
3 2 -1 0

Line of thoughts:
1. The problem is in CNF format with 3 variables and 5 clauses.
2. We have to find values for the variables (1, 2, 3) that satisfy all the clauses.

Start solving:
- For the first two lines:
3 2 -1 0
3 2 -1 0
Both of these lines mean that either 3 OR 2 OR -1 should be True.
To satisfy this, we can set variable 3 to True.

- For the third line:
2 -1 -3 0
This means either 2 OR -1 OR -3 should be True, since 3 has already been set to True, we can set -1 to True to satisfy this clause.

- For the fourth line:
-1 2 3 0
This means either -1 OR 2 OR 3 should be True, which is already satisfied by setting -1 and 3 to True earlier.

- For the fifth line:
3 2 -1 0
This clause is already satisfied by setting 3 and -1 to True earlier.

Final answer:
answer: 3 -1 -2
