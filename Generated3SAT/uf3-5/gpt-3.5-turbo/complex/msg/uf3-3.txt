To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can first rewrite the clauses in a more readable format:
1. (3 OR 1 OR NOT 2)
2. (NOT 2 OR 3 OR 1)
3. (NOT 2 OR NOT 3 OR 1)
4. (3 OR NOT 1 OR NOT 2)
5. (1 OR NOT 2 OR 3)

Next, we can create a truth table to systematically go through all possible assignments of truth values to the variables 1, 2, and 3. Let's represent false as 0 and true as 1:

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 1 OR 2 OR NOT 3 | NOT 2 OR 3 OR 1 | NOT 2 OR NOT 3 OR 1 | 3 OR NOT 1 OR NOT 2 | 1 OR NOT 2 OR 3 | Satisfiability |
|---|---|---|------------------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1                | 0              | 0                  | 1                   | 0              | Not satisfied   |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1                | 1              | 1                  | 1                   | 1              | Satisfied       |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1                | 1              | 1                  | 1                   | 1              | Satisfied       |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1                | 1              | 1                  | 1                   | 0              | Not satisfied   |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1                | 0              | 1                  | 0                   | 1              | Not satisfied   |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1                | 1              | 1                  | 1                   | 1              | Satisfied       |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1                | 1              | 1                  | 0                   | 1              | Not satisfied   |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1                | 0              | 1                  | 0                   | 1              | Not satisfied   |

From the truth table, we can see that the second and third rows satisfy all the clauses. Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:
answer: 0 1 1
