To solve this problem, we first need to understand the DIMACS format provided. 

The first line specifies that there are 3 variables and 5 clauses in the problem. 
The following 5 lines represent the 5 clauses in conjunctive normal form (CNF). 
Each number represents a variable, with a negative sign indicating negation. 
The number 0 denotes the end of each clause. 

Now, let's analyze each clause one by one:

1. -3 2 -1 
This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 2 to True, variable 1 to False, and variable 3 to False. 

2. 3 2 -1
This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 3 to True, variable 2 to True, and variable 1 to False. 

3. -1 2 -3
This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 1 to False, variable 2 to True, and variable 3 to False. 

4. -1 -3 2
This clause can be satisfied by setting variable 1 to False, variable 3 to False, and variable 2 to True. 

5. -1 -3 2
This clause is a duplicate of the previous clause and can be ignored.

Therefore, the satisfying assignment for the clauses is:
Variable 1 = False
Variable 2 = True
Variable 3 = False

answer: 2 -1 -3
