To solve this problem, let's first understand the DIMACS format. 

The first line "p cnf 3 5" indicates that there are 3 variables and 5 clauses in the problem.

The next lines represent the clauses:
1. Clause: 2 1 3 0 -> (x2 or x1 or x3)
2. Clause: 3 1 -2 0 -> (x3 or x1 or ~x2)
3. Clause: 3 2 1 0 -> (x3 or x2 or x1)
4. Clause: 1 3 2 0 -> (x1 or x3 or x2)
5. Clause: 1 3 2 0 -> (x1 or x3 or x2)

Now, to solve the problem, we need to find an assignment of true or false to the variables x1, x2, and x3 that satisfies all the clauses.

Observing clauses 1 and 3, we can see that x3 must be True since it appears as a positive literal in both clauses.

Now, by assigning x3 = True, we see that clause 2 becomes true since ~x2 evaluates to False.

Lastly, clause 4 and 5 are both satisfied as x1 and x2 can be either True or False.

Therefore, the solution is:
x1 = False
x2 = False
x3 = True

answer: x1=False, x2=False, x3=True
