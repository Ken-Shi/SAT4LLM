To solve the provided SAT problem in DIMACS format, we need to find an assignment of truth values to the variables that satisfies all clauses. 

The DIMACS format specifies there are 3 variables and 5 clauses. 
The clauses are:
1. -3 2 1
2. -3 2 -1
3. -1 -3 2
4. 2 -3 -1
5. 2 1 3

Here is the line of thoughts to solve this problem:
1. Assume variable 3 is True: Since clauses 1, 2, and 4 contain -3, if 3 is True those clauses are automatically satisfied.
2. Based on clause 3 (-1 -3 2), if 3 is True, 2 must be True.
3. Based on clause 5 (2 1 3), since 2 is True, 1 must be True as well. 
4. Thus, the assignment 3=True, 2=True, 1=True satisfies all clauses.

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: 3=True, 2=True, 1=True
