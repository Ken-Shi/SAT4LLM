To solve this problem, we need to satisfy the clauses given in the DIMACS format. The problem has 3 variables and 5 clauses.

- First clause: -2 -1 3 -> This can be satisfied by assigning true values to variables 2 and 1.
- Second clause: -2 -1 -3 -> This can be satisfied by assigning true values to variables 2 and 1.
- Third clause: -3 -1 2 -> This can be satisfied by assigning true values to variables 3 and 1.
- Fourth clause: -2 3 -1 -> This can be satisfied by assigning true values to variables 2 and 3.
- Fifth clause: -3 -1 -2 -> This can be satisfied by assigning true values to variables 3 and 1.

Therefore, the clauses can be satisfied by assigning the following values to the variables:
1 = true
2 = true
3 = true

This assignment satisfies all 5 clauses, therefore it is a solution to the SAT problem.

Answer: 1 = true, 2 = true, 3 = true
