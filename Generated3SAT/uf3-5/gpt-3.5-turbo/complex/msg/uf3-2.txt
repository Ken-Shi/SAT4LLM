To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to analyze each clause and find a truth assignment that satisfies all the clauses.

The problem is defined by the following clauses:
1. (2 OR -3 OR 1)
2. (-3 OR 2 OR 1)
3. (2 OR 1 OR -3)
4. (-2 OR 1 OR -3)
5. (-3 OR -2 OR 1)

Let's analyze the clauses:

From clause 1, either 2, -3, or 1 must be true.
From clause 2, either -3, 2, or 1 must be true.
From clause 3, either 2, 1, or -3 must be true.
From clause 4, either -2, 1, or -3 must be true.
From clause 5, either -3, -2, or 1 must be true.

Now, let's try to find a truth assignment that satisfies all the clauses:

Let's assume 2 is true. In that case, clause 1 is satisfied, and clause 3 is satisfied as well. However, to satisfy clause 4, -2 must be false, which means 2 must be false, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, 2 must be false.

Now, let's assume 1 is true. In that case, clause 1 is satisfied, and clause 2 is satisfied as well. However, to satisfy clause 3, 2 must be false, which we already know. Therefore, 1 must be true.

Now, let's check the assignments for 1 and -3. If 1 is true, then clause 1 and clause 2 are satisfied. For clause 3, -3 must be true. This satisfies all the clauses, and therefore, the truth assignment that satisfies all the clauses is:
1 is true
-3 is true
2 is false

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: 1 -3 -2
