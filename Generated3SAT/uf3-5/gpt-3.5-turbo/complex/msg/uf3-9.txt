First, let's decode the DIMACS format:
- There are 3 variables (1, 2, 3)
- There are 5 clauses
- The clauses are:
  - Clause 1: (1 OR 3 OR NOT 2)
  - Clause 2: (1 OR NOT 2 OR 3)
  - Clause 3: (1 OR NOT 2 OR 3)
  - Clause 4: (3 OR NOT 2 OR 1)
  - Clause 5: (NOT 2 OR 1 OR 3)

Now, let's try to find a satisfying assignment. 

Looking at the clauses:
- If we assign Variable 1 to be true, clauses 1, 2, 3, and 5 are satisfied.
- If we assign Variable 3 to be true, clauses 1, 2, 3, and 4 are satisfied.

Therefore, we can satisfy all clauses by assigning Variable 1 and 3 to be true, which means Variable 2 is false.

Therefore, the satisfying assignment is:
- Variable 1 = true
- Variable 2 = false
- Variable 3 = true

So, the final answer is:
answer: 1 -2 3
