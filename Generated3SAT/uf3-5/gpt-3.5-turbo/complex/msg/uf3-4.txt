To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will first analyze the clauses provided:

1. 1 2 -3 0
2. -3 2 1 0
3. -3 1 2 0
4. -3 1 2 0
5. 1 2 -3 0

We can simplify the clauses as follows:
- Clause 1: (1 OR 2 OR NOT 3)
- Clause 2: (NOT 3 OR 2 OR 1)
- Clause 3: (NOT 3 OR 1 OR 2)
- Clause 4: (NOT 3 OR 1 OR 2)
- Clause 5: (1 OR 2 OR NOT 3)

Now, we can see that Clauses 3 and 4 are repeats, so we can simplify the problem further:
- Clause 1: (1 OR 2 OR NOT 3)
- Clause 2: (NOT 3 OR 2 OR 1)
- Clause 3: (NOT 3 OR 1 OR 2)

Next, we can see that Clauses 1 and 2 are complement of each other, so they can never be both true at the same time. Therefore, the only solution is when NOT 3 is true and 1 or 2 is true.

Hence, the final answer is: 
answer: 3 1
