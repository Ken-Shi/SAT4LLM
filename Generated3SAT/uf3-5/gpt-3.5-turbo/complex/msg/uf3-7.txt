To solve this problem, we first need to understand the DIMACS format provided. 

The line "p cnf 3 5" tells us that there are 3 variables and 5 clauses in the problem. 
The following lines represent the clauses in the problem. Each number represents a literal (either a variable or its negation), with '0' indicating the end of the clause. 

Now let's analyze the clauses:
1. -2 -3 -1 0 -> This means that either variable 2 or 3 must be false in order for the clause to be satisfied. 
2. -2 -1 -3 0 -> Either variable 2 or variable 1 must be false. 
3. -1 -2 -3 0 -> Same as clause 2, either variable 1 or variable 2 must be false. 
4. -3 -2 -1 0 -> Either variable 3 or variable 2 must be false. 
5. 2 -3 -1 0 -> Variable 2 must be true. 

Combining all the clauses, we can see that the only way to satisfy all clauses is to make variable 2 true, and variables 1 and 3 false. 

Therefore, the solution is: 
answer: 2=false, 1=false, 3=false
