First, let's interpret the problem encoded in DIMACS format:

p cnf 3 5
1 -2 -3 0
-2 1 3 0
-2 -3 1 0
3 -2 1 0
-3 -2 1 0

The problem has 3 variables and 5 clauses.

Next, let's write the clauses in a more readable format:
1. (1 or not 2 or not 3)
2. (not 2 or 1 or 3)
3. (not 2 or not 3 or 1)
4. (3 or not 2 or 1)
5. (not 3 or not 2 or 1)

Now, we can solve the SAT problem using logical deduction:

From clause 2, if 2 is false, then 1 must be true.
From clause 4, if 3 is true, then 2 must be false.
From clause 1, since 1 must be true and 2 is false, 3 must be true.
From clause 5, since 3 is true, 2 must be false, which contradicts the assignment from clause 4.

Therefore, this SAT problem is unsatisfiable. 

answer: unsatisfiable
