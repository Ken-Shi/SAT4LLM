To solve this SAT problem, we first convert the DIMACS format into a more readable form:

Clause 1: (2 OR 1 OR 3)
Clause 2: (1 OR 3 OR 2)
Clause 3: (NOT 3 OR 1 OR 2)
Clause 4: (1 OR 3 OR 2)
Clause 5: (3 OR 2 OR 1)

Now, we can simplify the problem by combining similar clauses and removing duplicates:

Clause 1, 2, and 4 can be combined to be: (1 OR 2 OR 3)
Clause 3 remains unchanged: (NOT 3 OR 1 OR 2)
Clause 5 remains unchanged: (3 OR 2 OR 1)

Now, we see that Clauses 1, 3, and 5 all contain variable 1. To satisfy these clauses, variable 1 must be true. Thus, we can remove variable 1 from these clauses, simplifying them to:

Clause 1: (2 OR 3)
Clause 3: (NOT 3 OR 2)
Clause 5: (3 OR 2)

Now, we see that for Clause 3 to be satisfied, variable 2 must be true. And for Clause 1 and 5 to be satisfied, variable 3 must be true. Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:

answer: 1 true, 2 true, 3 true
