To solve this SAT problem in DIMACS format, we first need to convert the given problem into a more readable format. 

The DIMACS format represents the problem as follows:
- The first line specifies that there are 3 variables and 5 clauses.
- Each of the following 5 lines represents a clause, ending with 0.

Now, let's convert the given problem into a more understandable format:
- Clause 1: ?x2 ? x1 ? ?x3
- Clause 2: x2 ? ?x3 ? x1
- Clause 3: x2 ? ?x3 ? x1
- Clause 4: ?x3 ? x1 ? x2
- Clause 5: ?x2 ? ?x3 ? x1

To solve this SAT problem, we need to find a combination of variable assignments that will satisfy all the clauses. Let's simplify each clause:
- Clause 1: Either x1 is true or x2 is false or x3 is false
- Clause 2: Either x2 is true or x1 is false or x3 is false
- Clause 3: Either x2 is true or x1 is false or x3 is false
- Clause 4: Either x1 is true or x2 is true or x3 is false
- Clause 5: Either x1 is true or x2 is false or x3 is false

Now, let's try to find a satisfying assignment. 

We can see that the only assignment that satisfies all clauses is:
- x1 = True
- x2 = False
- x3 = False

Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:
answer: x1 = True, x2 = False, x3 = False
