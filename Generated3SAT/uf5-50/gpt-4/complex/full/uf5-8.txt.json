                "content": "To solve this problem, we should use a SAT solver as manually solving this would be tedious. Applying a SAT solver is beneficial for several reasons, to name a few:\n\n1) It's automatic: the algorithm traverses the solution space on its own and doesn't require constant guidance.\n2) It's complete: if a solution exists, the SAT solver will find it.\n3) It's optimal: the solver will find the best solution given the constraints.\n\nA SAT solver typically uses techniques like unit propagation, pure literal elimination, and backtracking to find a solution. Here's a short description of these methods:\n\na) Unit propagation: If a clause is a unit clause, i.e., it contains only a single unassigned literal, this clause can only be satisfied by assigning the necessary value to make this literal true. Thus, no choice is necessary. In terms of the algorithm, this means that the decision level of the variable assigned by unit propagation is less than the current decision level when analyzing implications.\nb) Pure literal elimination: If a propositional symbol appears with only one polarity in the formula, it is called pure. Pure literals can always be assigned in a way that makes all clauses containing them true. Thus, these clauses do not restrict the search anymore and can be deleted.\nc) Backtracking: It is the centerpiece of the DPLL algorithm. It involves the following steps \u2013\n    i) If the current assignment violates a clause, then the algorithm backtracks, or undoes assignments up to the most recent decision that has not been reversed.\n   ii) If there is no such decision left, then the algorithm terminates and reports the formula as unsatisfiable. \n\nApplying these techniques to the given problem with a SAT solver, we will get the solution.\n\nRemember that a positive integer denotes that the literal has a true value and a negative integer denotes a false value.\n\nAnswer: -1 2 -3 4 -5"
