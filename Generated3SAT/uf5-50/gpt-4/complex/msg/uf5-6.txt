This is a SAT problem, which is solved by finding a way to assign true/false values to each logical variable in a way that makes all of the clauses true. 

The DIMACS format provided represents a set of logical clauses: each line is a separate clause, and each clause consists of numbers. The number N represents variable N, and -N represents the negation of variable N. The zero at the end of each line denotes the end of clause. Positive integers from 1 to 5 signify our variables.

There is no definitive process to follow or any algorithmic approach that always works efficiently for this kind of problem as it is NP-complete. Solving this involves searching through the solution space and depends heavily on heuristics, meaning, taking educated guesses. Oftentimes this is implemented digitally by employing SAT solvers.

However, simply for instructional purposes, let's try to find a solution for these constraints manually. This isn't a guaranteed method and might not work for larger or more complex problems. 

Firstly, some knowledge that we know already- each clause has to be true, meaning that for each line, at least one number has to be true.

For instance, take the first clause: -3 1 -4 0

It's saying, either -3 is true, or 1 is true, or -4 is true.

Analyzing different clauses, we could theoretically derive that the value for the variables could be:
1=True
2=True
3=False
4=False
5=True

For example:
If you look at 21st clause: 1 3 2 0. For this all to be true, 1 has to be true or 2 has to be true or 3 has to be true. Hence we derived, 1=true and 2= true and 3=False.

We can then validate this potential solution by substituting these values back into the formula and checking if every single clause is true, which can tell us if this is a valid solution.

The answer will be in the form of T and F's assigned to variables.

Answer: 1=T, 2=T, 3=F, 4=F, 5=T. 

With these answers, all constraints are met.
