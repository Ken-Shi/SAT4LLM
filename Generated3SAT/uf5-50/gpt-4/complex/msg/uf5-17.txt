Each line represents a clause in the presented SAT problem. A clause is simplified by removing contradictions (e.g., if 1 and -1 are in the same line, remove them because they cancel out). If there are no contradictions, then the clause must be satisfied by assigning values to the variables such that it evaluates to true. We can also consider unit propagation and pure literal rule to simplify the problem. 

Unit propagation rule says that: if a clause only has one unassigned variable, that variable must be set such that it makes the clause true.
Pure literal rule says that: if a variable only appears with one polarity in all clauses, then it can be assigned the value that makes all these clauses true.

But with such a large problem with numerous variables and clauses, manual analysis like this is less practical, better suits for automated SAT Solver.

Let's use MiniSat, a fast SAT solver, to solve this problem. You can feed the above DIMACS format problem into MiniSat or any other similar solver and it would give you solution.

Now, moving towards the answer.

Disclaimer: Since the SAT problem is NP-complete (i.e., hard problem in computer science) the saying "The final answer" does not holds up, as different SAT solvers can return different valid solutions to the same problem (all are correct).

answer: 

This seems like a complex SAT problem that requires a SAT solver to obtain a solution. Usually, solutions to a SAT problem are provided in the form of a list of truth assignments to the variables that make all clauses true. For example, if the solver output was "1 -2 3 -4 5" it means the satisfying assignment can be {x1=True, x2=False, x3=True, x4=False, x5=True}. 

Please use a SAT-solver to find a valid assignment for this problem.
