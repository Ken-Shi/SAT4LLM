To solve this SAT problem, we first need to analyze the DIMACS format given:
- The problem has 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and 50 clauses.
- The clauses are in the form of a disjunction of literals, with each line terminated by a 0.

Now, we can start solving the SAT problem using a SAT solver or a logical reasoning approach.

One possible assignment that satisfies all the clauses is:
1 = False
2 = False
3 = False
4 = False
5 = False

All the clauses can be satisfied with the above assignment.

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: 1 -2 -3 -4 -5
