To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use a SAT solver like MiniSat or Z3. However, since we don't have direct access to those tools in this platform, we can rely on logical reasoning to derive a solution.

Looking at the provided DIMACS-encoded SAT problem, we have 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and a total of 50 clauses. Each clause contains 3 literals separated by spaces with a '0' at the end.

We can start by simplifying and analyzing the clauses to see if we can deduce any contradictions or certain assignments that must be true. 

Here are the simplified filterings:

1. From clause -3 2 1, we can conclude that 1 must be true.
2. From clause 1 4 2, we can conclude that 1 and 2 must be true.
3. From clause 1 2 5, we can conclude that 1, 2, and 5 must be true.
4. From clause 5 1 4, we can conclude that 1, 4, and 5 must be true.
5. From clause -2 -5 1, we can conclude that 1 must be true.
6. From clause -5 -3 1, we can conclude that 1 must be true.
7. From clause -5 2 1, we can conclude that 1 and 2 must be true.

Based on the above filtering and logical deductions, we can see that variables 1 and 2 must be true.

Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:

answer: 1 1 0 0 0
