However, since we don't have direct access to those tools in this platform, we can rely on logical reasoning to derive a solution.\n\nLooking at the provided DIMACS-encoded SAT problem, we have 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and a total of 50 clauses. Each clause contains 3 literals separated by spaces with a '0' at the end.\n\nWe can start by simplifying and analyzing the clauses to see if we can deduce any contradictions or certain assignments that must be true. \n\nHere are the simplified filterings:\n\n1. From clause -3 2 1, we can conclude that 1 must be true.\n2. From clause 1 4 2, we can conclude that 1 and 2 must be true.\n3. From clause 1 2 5, we can conclude that 1, 2, and 5 must be true.\n4. From clause 5 1 4, we can conclude that 1, 4, and 5 must be true.\n5. From clause -2 -5 1, we can conclude that 1 must be true.\n6. From clause -5 -3 1, we can conclude that 1 must be true.\n7. From clause -5 2 1, we can conclude that 1 and 2 must be true.\n\nBased on the above filtering and logical deductions, we can see that variables 1 and 2 must be true.\n\nTherefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:\n\nanswer: 1 1 0 0 0"
