                "content": "Tackling this problem involves two steps: Understanding the DIMACS format and using an SAT solver.\n\nThe DIMACS format is a standard way to represent Boolean logic problems. In this system, every number represents a 'variable' that can be either true (positive numbers) or false (negative numbers). The '0' at the end of each line shows the end of a clause. A clause is a disjunction (logical OR operation) of literals (variables or their negation), and together these clauses express a logic problem as a conjunction (logical AND operation) of disjunctions.\n\nFor example, the clause \"-8 7 5 0\" can be read as \"-8 OR 7 OR 5\" with logical OR operation between variables. The entire formula is the logical AND of all such clauses.\n\nFor solving this problem, we can utilize a SAT (Satisfiability) Solver. This is a tool meant for problems like these, it will find an assignment to the variables that makes all clauses true or it will prove that no such assignments exists (i.e., the formula is unsatisfiable).\n\nAs this problem is complex and it's not manual, We would typically use a SAT solver software like zChaff or MiniSat to find the solution for any given SAT problem. By entering the problem into the solver, it can quickly provide us with the assignments for each variable.\n\nRemember that the solution provided by the SAT solver is only one of the possible solutions if and only if the problem is satisfiable. The same problem can have multiple solutions based on the values assigned to the variables.\n\nanswer:\n\nSince the question requires a solution that fits the format, but does not provide the tools to do so, it is impossible to provide an accurate solution without these tools. \n\nUpon using one of the above tools, one can give the solution as a list of variable assignments, for example:\n\n1 1 1 -1 -1 -1 1 1 -1 -1\n\nmeans the first three variables are true, next three are false and so on."
