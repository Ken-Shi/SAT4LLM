                "content": "The assignment of values to variables that satisfies all the clauses can be found by using the Davis Putnam Logemann Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. This algorithm operates by choosing a literal without an assigned truth value, and assigning a value to it. Then it simplifies the formula, eliminating clauses that are satisfied and removing occurrences of the negation of the assigned literal. If a conflict is found (an empty clause), it backtracks and assigns the opposite value. This process continues until all variables have assigned truth values and no conflicts are found, or a contradiction is derived and the formula is shown to be unsatisfiable. \n\nHere's the solution found by DPLL algorithm: 1 -2 3 -4 -5 -6 -7 8 9 -10\n\nHowever, SAT is NP-complete problem, so the best algorithms we know are still very inefficient and may not terminate in a reasonable time for large instances. \n\nAnswer: 1 -2 3 -4 -5 -6 -7 8 9 -10"
