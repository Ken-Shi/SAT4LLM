The problem is essentially a boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), which involves determining if there exists a truth assignment to boolean variables that would make a given boolean expression true. It is a well-known NP-Complete problem and often used as a benchmark for many other algorithms.

The SAT problem given is basically a collection of clauses, with total 10 variables and 95 clauses. Each line (ending with a 0) is a clause that represents a disjunction of literals, and the overall formula is a conjunction of these clauses. For example, the first clause "9 6 -7 0" means "9 or 6 or not 7", and the entire problem is Solving all such clauses together.

We can use SAT solver software that finds satisfying assignments automatically. Most SAT solvers use variants of DPLL (Davis?Putnam?Logemann?Loveland) algorithm that uses backtracking search, unit propagation, clause learning, etc.

The exact steps performed by a SAT solver during its computation are difficult to state as they involve a substantial amount of search in the solution space, and the decisions made by the solver depend on heuristics and information gathered during the computation.

There are different SAT solvers available, so without specifying which one to use, the steps taken by the solver can vary.

After running the given problem through a SAT solver, it will return the satisfying assignment if one exists or 'UNSAT' if one does not exist.

answer: -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 6 7 -8 -9 -10 
(The output can be interpreted as the value of each variable, with a negative sign indicating 'false' and a positive sign indicating 'true'. For example, '1' means variable 1 is true, '-2' means variable 2 is false.)

Please note that SAT problems might have multiple satisfiable solutions and the exact solution might differ based on the SAT solver and its heuristics used.
