This problem is a straightforward problem of propositional logic that can be solved using a SAT solver. A SAT solver is a computer program used for solving satisfiability problems, which are problems in propositional logic. The input for a SAT solver is a Boolean expression, and the solver attempts to find an assignment of truth values to the variables that makes the expression true. If such an assignment exists, the solver returns it; otherwise, it reports that the problem has no solution.

The DIMACS format used here is a standard format for expressing propositional logic problems. Each line represents a clause of the logic problem, and each integer represents a literal (a variable or its negation). A literal is positive if its integer is positive, and negative if its integer is negative. The integer value itself represents the absolute value of the corresponding variable.

The problem is under conjunctive normal form (CNF), which means, in this context, that the entire problem is a conjunction (an AND operation) of several disjunctive clauses (clauses linked by OR operations). The problem is to find an assignment of truth values to the variables that satisfies all the clauses.

SAT problems are NP-complete, meaning that they are computationally difficult to solve, and the necessary resources grow exponentially with the size of the problem. However, modern SAT solvers can handle problems with tens of thousands of variables up to a few million clauses.

I am using a SAT solver to generate the solution to this problem.
