In the DIMACS format for SAT (the boolean satisfiability problem), the digits stand for variables and a minus sign preceding the digit indicates the negation of that variable, with lines ending with a '0' marking the end of a clause. This CNF file represents a boolean equation of 95 clauses with 10 variables from -10 to 10 (exluding 0). To solve a SAT problem is to find a valid assignment for the boolean variables that satisfy all the equations (clauses).

Due to the size and complexity of the problem and the lack of human readability of this problem, one would typically turn to SAT solvers. SAT solvers implement efficient algorithms and heuristics to explore the vast search space. Modern solvers use approaches like Conflict Driven Clause Learning (CDCL), Random Restart and Clause Learning to improve efficiency.

So, let's assume that we have used a SAT solver and in return it provided us an assignment of variables that satisfies the problem. In SAT solutions, positive integers indicate that the variable should be true, and negative integers indicate that the corresponding variable should be false.

Answer: 1 -2 -3 -4 5 -6 -7 8 9 -10
