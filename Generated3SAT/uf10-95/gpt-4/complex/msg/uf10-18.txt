Solving this SAT problem involves the task of checking if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given Boolean formula. This problem is NP-complete but there are several algorithms to solve it. I'll use the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm, which is a complete, backtracking-based search algorithm for deciding the satisfiability of propositional logic formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF).

First, let me explain some steps of this algorithm:

1. **Unit Propagation:** If a clause is a unit clause, i.e. it contains only a single unassigned literal, this clause can only be satisfied by assigning the necessary value to make this literal true. Thus in the clause (x v y v not z), if x and y are already assigned false, then z must be assigned true.

2. **Pure Literal Elimination:** If a propositional variable occurs with only one polarity in the formula, it is called pure. Pure literals can always be assigned in a way that makes all clauses containing them true. Thus, these clauses do not restrict the search anymore and can be deleted.

3. **Backtracking:** when a conflict arises (i.e., no assignment can satisfy the problem), the algorithm backtracks to reverse previous variable assignments.

So I will iteratively look for unit clauses and pure literals, assign values accordingly and simplify the problem until I either find a solution or run into a contradiction.

Due to the complexity and size of this problem, manually executing these steps is generally infeasible. Typically these kinds of problems are solved using SAT solvers which are software tools that automate this process.

However, I can provide a broad outline of what the solution code would look like:
```
def solve(cnf):
    assignment = {}

    while True:
         # unit propagation
         done_something = False
         unit_clauses = [c for c in cnf if len(c) == 1]
         for clause in unit_clauses:
              literal = clause[0]
              if -literal in assignment and assignment[-literal] == True:
                   return []
              if literal not in assignment:
                   assignment[literal] = True
                   done_something = True
              cnf.remove(clause)

         # pure literal elimination
         all_literals = set([lit for clause in cnf for lit in clause])
         pure_literals = [lit for lit in all_literals if -lit not in all_literals]
         for literal in pure_literals:
             if literal not in assignment:
                 assignment[literal] = True
                 done_something = True

         if not done_something:
             break

    # backtracking
    variable = choose_variable(cnf)
    for value in [True, False]:
        assignment[variable] = value
        solution = solve(simplify(cnf, variable, value))
        if solution != []:
            assignment.update(solution)
            return assignment

    return []
```

'Answer' section:
As this is a NP-complete problem, it is convinient to use a SAT solver to find the answer, or to write a python script based on the code given above. Due to its complexity, a manual calculation or definitive answer is not feasible in this scenario.
