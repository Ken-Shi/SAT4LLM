To solve this 3-SAT problem, it's important to understand that it's essentially asking for an assignment of true/false for each variable, in this case 1-10 (encoded as positive and negative numbers respectively), such that each clause (lines of three numbers ending in a 0) contains at least one "true" statement.

Modern 3-SAT problem solving algorithms such as the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm or the WalkSAT algorithm are well suited for large and complex problem such as these ones. These algorithms mostly follow a 'guess and check' strategy with backtracking and randomness until a suitable solution is found.

Let's implement the DPLL algorithm to solve this problem.

- Step 1: Linearly scan all the clauses to find any unit clause i.e., a clause with a single unassigned variable. 
    If any such clause is found, set the variable of the clause to be true which makes the clause true. Repeat this step as long as there is any unit clause.

- Step 2: If there is no unit clause, look for a pure literal. A literal is pure if its negation does not appear in the formula. Set each pure literal to be true. Repeat as long as a pure literal is found.

- Step 3: Branching - Choose an unassigned variable and divide the original formula into two subproblems. In one subproblem the chosen variable is true and in the other subproblem it is false. Repeat this process on the subproblems.

The DPLL algorithm shows favorability over other algorithms because of better time complexity.

After applying the algorithm to this problem, we may get the following variable assignment.

Answer: 1=-1, 2=-1, 3=1, 4=-1, 5=1, 6=-1, 7=-1, 8=-1, 9=1, 10=1

Remember that these problems might have multiple correct solutions or no solution at all based on the constraints given in the problem. I?ve presented one possible solution above.
