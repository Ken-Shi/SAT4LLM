This problem is encoded in CNF (conjunctive normal form) format using the DIMACS standard. The problem involves 10 variables and 95 clauses. To solve this problem, we need to determine the truth values of the variables such that all the clauses are satisfied.

To solve this SAT problem, we can use a SAT solver such as MiniSat or Z3. These solvers are capable of determining whether a given CNF formula is satisfiable or not.

I will now use a SAT solver to find a solution to this problem.
