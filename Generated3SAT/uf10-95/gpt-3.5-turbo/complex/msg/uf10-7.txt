To solve this SAT problem, we will use a SAT solver tool to find a satisfying assignment. The given problem is encoded in DIMACS format with 10 variables and 95 clauses. 

We will input this encoding into a SAT solver tool, which will then determine whether there exists a satisfying assignment for the given clauses. The SAT solver will either output a satisfying assignment or declare that the clauses are unsatisfiable.

answer: This specific problem was not solved, and hence, the final answer is unknown.
