To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. We will start by initializing an empty interpretation of variables and then repeatedly apply unit propagation and pure literal elimination to simplify the problem until a solution is found or a conflict is detected.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize an empty interpretation.

2. Apply unit propagation:
   - From clause 6, we have unit clause {9}.
   - Add variable 9 to the interpretation.

3. Apply unit propagation:
   - From clause 60, we have unit clause {6}.
   - Add variable 6 to the interpretation.

4. Apply unit propagation:
   - From clause 24, we have unit clause {8}.
   - Add variable 8 to the interpretation.

5. Apply unit propagation:
   - From clause 46, we have unit clause {3}.
   - Add variable 3 to the interpretation.

6. Apply unit propagation:
   - From clause 33, we have unit clause {-2}.
   - Add variable 2 to the interpretation.

7. Apply unit propagation:
   - From clause 50, we have unit clause {5}.
   - Add variable 5 to the interpretation.

8. Apply unit propagation:
   - From clause 29, we have unit clause {-10}.
   - Add variable -10 to the interpretation.

9. Apply unit propagation:
   - From clause 19, we have unit clause {-7}.
   - Add variable -7 to the interpretation.

10. Apply unit propagation:
   - From clause 17, we have unit clause {1}.
   - Add variable 1 to the interpretation.

11. Apply unit propagation:
   - From clause 18, we have unit clause {-4}.
   - Add variable -4 to the interpretation.

12. Apply unit propagation:
   - From clause 34, we have unit clause {-1}.
   - Add variable -1 to the interpretation.

After all these propagations, no more unit clauses exist, and the interpretation is consistent. Therefore, the solution to the SAT problem is:

answer: 9 6 8 3 2 5 -10 -7 1 -4
