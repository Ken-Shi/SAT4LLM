Start with an empty assignment.\n\n2. Pick a literal from the clauses. In this case, we will start with the first one: 10 -7 -6\n\n3. Assign the literal the value TRUE and update the assignment with 10: TRUE.\n\n4. Simplify the remaining clauses by removing clauses that contain 10 as TRUE and removing -7 and -6 as FALSE.\n\n5. Repeat this process for all clauses until all clauses are satisfied or contradicted.\n\n6. If at any point during the process we reach a contradiction, we backtrack and try a different assignment.\n\n7. If we are able to satisfy all clauses, then we have found a satisfying assignment.\n\nLet's apply this process to the given clauses and see if we can find a satisfying assignment.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\nanswer: This instance is unsatisfiable."
