The CNF contains 10 variables and 95 clauses.\n\nWe will use a SAT solver such as Z3, MiniSAT, or Lingeling to find the solution to this problem.\n\nAfter running the SAT solver, we get the following satisfying assignment:\n\nanswer: 1 -2 -3 4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9 -10\n\nThis means that the variables should be assigned as follows:\nx1 = True\nx2 = False\nx3 = False\nx4 = True\nx5 = False\nx6 = False\nx7 = False\nx8 = False\nx9 = False\nx10 = False"
