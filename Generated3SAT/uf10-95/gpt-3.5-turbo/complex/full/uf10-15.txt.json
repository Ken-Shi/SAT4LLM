Select variable 1 as true.\n2. Clause 1 is satisfied by setting 1 to true.\n3. Propagate unit clause 1.\n4. Select variable 7 as true.\n5. Clause 18 is satisfied by setting 7 to true.\n6. Propagate the unit clause 7.\n7. Select variable 4 as true.\n8. Clause 14 is satisfied by setting 4 to true.\n9. Propagate the unit clause 4.\n10. Select variable 9 as true.\n11. Clause 19 is satisfied by setting 9 to true.\n12. Propagate the unit clause 9.\n13. Select variable 6 as true.\n14. Clause 2 is satisfied by setting 6 to true.\n15. Propagate the unit clause 6.\n16. Select variable 3 as true.\n17. Clause 5 is satisfied by setting 3 to true.\n18. Propagate the unit clause 3.\n19. Select variable 5 as true.\n20. Clause 4 is satisfied by setting 5 to true.\n21. Propagate the unit clause 5.\n22. No unassigned variables left. All clauses are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format is:\nanswer: 1 1 -1 0 -2 0 -3 0 -4 0 5 0 -6 0 -7 0 -8 0 -9 0 10 "
