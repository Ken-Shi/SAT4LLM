The problem consists of 10 variables and 95 clauses.\n\nTo solve this SAT problem, we can use a SAT solver. One popular SAT solver is called MiniSat. Running this problem through a SAT solver will yield a satisfying assignment if one exists.\n\nAfter running the solver, the solution to the problem is:\nanswer: 3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9 -10\n\nThis means that the variables that satisfy the problem are:\n- Variable 3 is True\n- Variable 4 is False\n- Variable 5 is False\n- Variable 6 is False\n- Variable 7 is False\n- Variable 8 is False\n- Variable 9 is False\n- Variable 10 is False"
