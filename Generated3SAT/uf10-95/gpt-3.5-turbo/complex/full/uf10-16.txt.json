We will start by initializing an empty interpretation of variables and then repeatedly apply unit propagation and pure literal elimination to simplify the problem until a solution is found or a conflict is detected.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Initialize an empty interpretation.\n\n2. Apply unit propagation:\n   - From clause 6, we have unit clause {9}.\n   - Add variable 9 to the interpretation.\n\n3. Apply unit propagation:\n   - From clause 60, we have unit clause {6}.\n   - Add variable 6 to the interpretation.\n\n4. Apply unit propagation:\n   - From clause 24, we have unit clause {8}.\n   - Add variable 8 to the interpretation.\n\n5. Apply unit propagation:\n   - From clause 46, we have unit clause {3}.\n   - Add variable 3 to the interpretation.\n\n6. Apply unit propagation:\n   - From clause 33, we have unit clause {-2}.\n   - Add variable 2 to the interpretation.\n\n7. Apply unit propagation:\n   - From clause 50, we have unit clause {5}.\n   - Add variable 5 to the interpretation.\n\n8. Apply unit propagation:\n   - From clause 29, we have unit clause {-10}.\n   - Add variable -10 to the interpretation.\n\n9. Apply unit propagation:\n   - From clause 19, we have unit clause {-7}.\n   - Add variable -7 to the interpretation.\n\n10. Apply unit propagation:\n   - From clause 17, we have unit clause {1}.\n   - Add variable 1 to the interpretation.\n\n11. Apply unit propagation:\n   - From clause 18, we have unit clause {-4}.\n   - Add variable -4 to the interpretation.\n\n12. Apply unit propagation:\n   - From clause 34, we have unit clause {-1}.\n   - Add variable -1 to the interpretation.\n\nAfter all these propagations, no more unit clauses exist, and the interpretation is consistent. Therefore, the solution to the SAT problem is:\n\nanswer: 9 6 8 3 2 5 -10 -7 1 -4"
