Each line after \"p cnf\" represents a clause with the numbers indicating the literals. Positive numbers represent variables that are true, while negative numbers represent variables that are false. \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find an assignment of true/false values to the variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) that satisfies all the clauses. This is a SAT problem.\n\nWe will use a SAT solver to find the solution.\n\nanswer: SATISFIABLE\nAssignment: 1=true, 2=false, 3=true, 4=true, 5=false"
