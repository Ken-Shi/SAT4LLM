This problem is in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), a common way to represent boolean formulas as sets of clauses. Each line after "p cnf" represents a clause with the numbers indicating the literals. Positive numbers represent variables that are true, while negative numbers represent variables that are false. 

To solve this problem, we need to find an assignment of true/false values to the variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) that satisfies all the clauses. This is a SAT problem.

We will use a SAT solver to find the solution.

answer: SATISFIABLE
Assignment: 1=true, 2=false, 3=true, 4=true, 5=false
