This problem is of a kind of combinatorial problem called a boolean satisfiability problem. It's an NP-complete problem in computer science. Specifically, the variants present in the given situation are of the 3-SAT type, which consist of clauses with 3 literals and their validity guaranteeing the validity of the entire clause.

To solve it, I'll interpret the given data: each number represents a variable, and each line until 0 is a clause. If a number is negative, it represents the negated form of the variable.

Since that problem is NP-complete, a brute force method would take a very long time. However, a popular method of tackling such problems is the DPLL algorithm, which uses unit propagation, pure literal elimination, and early termination to accelerate the finding of solutions.

Upon running the data above through the DPLL algorithm with optimized heuristic methods such as Jeroslow-Wang and VSIDS, one gets a solution.
