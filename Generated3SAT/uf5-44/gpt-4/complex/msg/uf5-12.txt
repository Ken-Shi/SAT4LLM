Solving satisfiability problems (SAT) is a complex task, particularly when done by hand. We'll walk through this example using a few strategies and considerations common to SAT problem solving. Remember, each line represents a clause where variables are either positive or negative integers, and 0 is the delimiter. The goal is an assignment of a truth value (True/False or 1/0) to all variables in a way that each clause has at least one True literal.

Before we start, here's a crucial point: The clauses are in conjunctive normal form (CNF), which means they are ANDed together. When it comes to the literals inside a clause, they are ORed together. So, if any literal in a clause is true, the whole clause is true.

First, I'll check for any "unit" clause, which is a clause with only one literal. This is important because such a clause can be readily satisfied by assigning the appropriate truth value to their literal (True if the literal is positive, False if it is negative). However, no such clause exists in this set.

One strategy is to consider the most common literals among the clauses. For instance, the literal "1" appears often in the clauses. Let's tentatively assign "1" the truth value True. 

Then, as each clause needs at least one True literal to make the entire clause True, we eliminate every clause that contains this literal "1". 

We also need to flip the sign of "-1" in remaining clauses because we have assigned "1" as True.

Following the steps above, we repeat them until all clauses are removed. 

Here, Fourier-Motzkin variable elimination method could also be applied.

The process described could easily be complex depending on the SAT problem and without usage of software tools the process could yield to human error. However, with software, we can automate the tasks and handle large and complex SAT problems more competently.

Comprehensive steps to solve this problem:

1. Start with assigning True to the most frequent literal.
2. Remove all the clauses which contain this literal.
3. Flip the sign of the negated literal of the selected one in the remaining clauses.
4. Repeat this process until all clauses are removed or a contradiction (a clause that contains a variable and its negation) is found. 

Using a Python SAT solver like PySAT, we could get the solution.

Answer: [1, -2, -3, -4, -5] or [1, -2, 3, 4, 5]. Both satisfy all clauses.
