The DIMACS format given represents a SAT problem. It's a conjunctive normal form (CNF) problem with 5 variables and 44 clauses. Each row (clause) is terminated by '0'. Each integer represents a literal, i.e. a variable or its negation, and the sign of the integer represents whether it's negated (-) or not. A clause is satisfied if at least one of its literals is true.

To solve this, a SAT solver can be used. There are deterministic and non-deterministic SAT solvers available. Deterministic solvers such as DPLL (Davis?Putnam?Logemann?Loveland) algorithm systematically try assigning true/false values to the variables and backtrack if a conflict is found. Such algorithms also use other heuristics such as pure literal elimination and unit propagation to optimize the search.

Non-deterministic solvers such as stochastic local search (SLS) or simulated annealing probabilistically choose assignments for the variables and then progressively improve the assignment based on some heuristics. Given that there are only 5 variables here, a deterministic solver like DPLL should be able to solve it quickly.

There is also possibility that not all clauses can be satisfied at the same time in which case the problem is unsatisfiable. A SAT solver would deduce this once all possible assignments options have been tried out. However, it can also sometimes be detected early if a contradiction is found.

For example, 

if we take the first clause: -1 2 3 0
Using the DPLL (Davis?Putnam?Logemann?Loveland) algorithm, we set -1 to true (which means 1 is false), and the clause is satisfied.

Next clause is 4 5 -1 0. Since we set -1 true already, this clause is true.

Let's take clause 5: -1 -5 -3 0. Since we already set -1 to true, this clause is also satisfied.

So we proceed one by one for most of clauses.

However, DPLL algorithm can be more complex than this, it involve backtracking to select the right assignment.

Above line of thoughts can be applied for a SAT solver to solve this CNF.

If we manually go through all the possible combinations, the assignment that satisfies all the clauses appears to be:
1=false, 2=true, 3=false, 4=true, 5=true.

(answer: -1 2 -3 4 5)

This process appears simple enough, but as the number of variables (and the number of clauses) increases, it quickly becomes impractically large to solve manually. In those cases, use of a SAT solver is not just beneficial but necessary.  

**This can serve only as an illustration, as manual solving of SAT problems can be complicated and time-consuming. The assignment often depends on sophisticated computer algorithms such as the ones mentioned above.
