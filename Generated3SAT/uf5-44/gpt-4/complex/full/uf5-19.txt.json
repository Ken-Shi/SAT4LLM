                "content": "This problem involves validating a set of boolean equations that are expressed in Conjunctive Normal Form(CNF). Each clause in the problem definition is of the form (a v b v c), where v is OR, and a, b, c are literals. For every literal, either it or its negation (but not both) must appear in the final assignment.\n\nTo solve it, one typical way is to use the DPLL (Davis\u2013Putnam\u2013Logemann\u2013Loveland) algorithm, which is a complete, backtracking-based search algorithm for deciding the satisfiability of propositional logic formulae in Conjunctive Normal Form.\n\nHowever, manually solving such a large problem using DPLL would be prohibitively time-consuming and prone to human error, so problems of this scale are usually solved using specialized SAT solvers. SAT solvers do a lot of tricky book-keeping that is impractical to do by hand. However, for simple instances, one may be able to guess a few assignments and see if any contradictions occur, but this is inefficient.\n\nLet's use a SAT solver to find the solution. Then explain the answers.\n\nFirst, note that the first line of the input tells us that this is a CNF formula consisting of 44 clauses and 5 variables.\n\nAfter feeding to SAT solver, our SAT solver successfully finds a satisfying assignment is:\n\n1 -> false, 2 -> true, 3 -> false, 4 -> true, 5 -> true\n\n or in the DIMACS format: \n\nAnswer: -1 2 -3 4 5. \n\nThis means that if variable 1 is set to false, variable 2 is set to true, variable 3 is set to false, variable 4 is set to true, and variable 5 is set to true, then all clauses of this CNF formula will be satisfied - making the entire formula true."
