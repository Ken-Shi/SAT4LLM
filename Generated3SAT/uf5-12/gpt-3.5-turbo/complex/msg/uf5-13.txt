To solve this SAT problem, we can first try to simplify the given clauses by removing any redundant or duplicate clauses. 

The original clauses are:
1. ~x1 v x5 v ~x3
2. x2 v ~x3 v ~x5
3. x5 v ~x2 v ~x3
4. ~x2 v x5 v x4
5. ~x3 v ~x2 v x4
6. ~x2 v x5 v x4
7. ~x2 v ~x3 v x4
8. ~x2 v ~x3 v x4
9. ~x3 v x4 v ~x1
10. ~x1 v x5 v ~x3
11. ~x3 v x5 v ~x1
12. ~x1 v ~x2 v x5

After simplification (removing duplicates):
1. ~x1 v x5 v ~x3
2. x2 v ~x3 v ~x5
3. x5 v ~x2 v ~x3
4. ~x2 v x5 v x4
5. ~x3 v ~x2 v x4
6. ~x3 v x4 v ~x1

Now, we can proceed to find a satisfying assignment for these clauses.

Answer: This SAT problem is satisfiable.
