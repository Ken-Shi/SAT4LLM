To solve this SAT problem, let's first translate the problem from DIMACS format to a more readable format:

(5 OR NOT 4 OR 3)
(4 OR 1 OR 5)
(3 OR 2 OR NOT 5)
(NOT 4 OR 1 OR 2)
(NOT 5 OR NOT 1 OR 4)
(2 OR 3 OR NOT 4)
(2 OR NOT 3 OR 1)
(NOT 4 OR NOT 1 OR NOT 3)
(2 OR NOT 5 OR NOT 3)
(NOT 5 OR 3 OR NOT 2)
(1 OR 4 OR 3)
(NOT 4 OR 2 OR 3)

Now, let's try to find a solution by assigning truth values to the variables:

- Let's first try setting 5 to True:
    - Then, we have: (5 OR NOT 4 OR 3) -> True
    - So, 4 and 3 must both be False, but 4 and 3 cannot both be False at the same time. This means setting 5 to True does not work.

- Now, let's try setting 5 to False:
    - Since (NOT 5 OR NOT 1 OR 4) exists, we set 1 to False and 4 to True.
    - Since (NOT 5 OR 3 OR NOT 2) exists, we set 2 to False and 3 to True.
    - Since (2 OR 3 OR NOT 4) exists, we set 2 and 3 to True, which is consistent with our previous assignments.
    - Since (4 OR 2 OR 3) exists, we set 4, 2, and 3 to True, which is consistent with our previous assignments.

Therefore, the solution is:
1 = False
2 = True
3 = True
4 = True
5 = False

answer: 2 -3 4
