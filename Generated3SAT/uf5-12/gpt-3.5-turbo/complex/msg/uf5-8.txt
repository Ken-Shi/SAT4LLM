First, let's decode the problem encoded in DIMACS format:

p cnf 5 12
1 4 -5 0
-5 3 -2 0
-1 -2 -3 0
-5 -2 -3 0
-2 -3 4 0
-3 4 -2 0
1 4 5 0
4 -5 1 0
-5 -2 3 0
4 -2 -3 0
-5 -3 -2 0
-3 -5 1 0

The header indicates that there are 5 variables and 12 clauses.

Now, let's try to solve this by inspection:

- Looking at clauses 1, 7, and 8, we see that variables 1 and 4 must be true, and variable 5 must be false.
- From clauses 2, 4, and 9, we get that variables 2 and 3 must be false, and variable 5 is true.
- In clauses 5 and 6, we find that variable 2 must be true and variable 3 must be false.

However, there seems to be a contradiction between the above conclusions. Hence, there is no possible assignment of truth values that can satisfy all the clauses simultaneously.

So, the problem is unsatisfiable.

answer: unsatisfiable
