To solve this problem, we need to assign values of true or false to each of the 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) in order to satisfy all 12 clauses.

Following the DIMACS format, we can rewrite the clauses in a more readable way:
1. (4 OR 1 OR NOT 5)
2. (2 OR NOT 1 OR 3)
3. (NOT 1 OR NOT 5 OR 2)
4. (2 OR NOT 1 OR NOT 5)
5. (2 OR 1 OR NOT 4)
6. (NOT 3 OR NOT 1 OR 4)
7. (1 OR NOT 4 OR 2)
8. (NOT 1 OR NOT 3 OR 2)
9. (NOT 5 OR 1 OR 2)
10. (NOT 5 OR 4 OR 1)
11. (2 OR 4 OR NOT 3)
12. (NOT 4 OR NOT 5 OR 2)

We can now start assigning values to the variables to satisfy the clauses:

Let's start with variable 1:
- If we set 1 to true:
  - Clause 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10 are satisfied.
  - Clause 3, 8 may not be satisfied.
- If we set 1 to false:
  - Clause 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 are satisfied.
  - Clause 1, 3, 9 may not be satisfied.

Now, let's move on to variable 2:
- If we set 2 to true:
  - Clause 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12 are satisfied.
  - Clause 1, 3, 6 may not be satisfied.
- If we set 2 to false:
  - Clause 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 are satisfied.
  - Clause 2, 4 may not be satisfied.

Variable 3 does not appear as a negative value in any clause, so we can set it to true to satisfy all clauses containing it.

Variables 4 and 5 have a lot of dependencies, so let's test different options for each:
- If we set 4 to true:
  - Clause 1, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12 are satisfied.
  - Clause 2, 6 may not be satisfied.
- If we set 4 to false:
  - Clause 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12 are satisfied.
  - Clause 1, 9, 10 may not be satisfied.

- If we set 5 to true:
  - Clause 1, 3, 9, 10 are satisfied.
  - Clause 2, 4, 5 may not be satisfied.
- If we set 5 to false:
  - Clause 3, 5, 10 are satisfied.
  - Clause 1, 9 may not be satisfied.

After analyzing all possibilities, we find that the assignment that satisfies all clauses is:
1. True (1)
2. False (2)
3. True (3)
4. True (4)
5. False (5)

Therefore, the solution to the SAT problem is:
answer: 1 -2 3 4 -5
