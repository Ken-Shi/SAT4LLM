To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use a SAT solver such as MiniSat or Z3. However, we can also try to simplify the problem by hand.

We have 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and 12 clauses. Let's analyze each clause:

1. -2 5 1: This clause is satisfied if variables 2 and 5 are true, or if variable 1 is false.
2. -3 4 5: This clause is satisfied if variables 3 and 4 are false, or if variable 5 is true.
3. 4 -3 5: This clause is satisfied if variable 4 is true, and either variable 3 is false or variable 5 is true.
4. 4 5 -2: This clause is satisfied if variable 4 and 5 are true, and variable 2 is false.
5. 4 5 1: This clause is satisfied if variables 4, 5, and 1 are all true.
6. 4 -5 -3: This clause is satisfied if variable 4 is true, and either variable 5 or 3 is false.
7. -2 1 4: This clause is satisfied if either variable 2 is false, or variables 1 and 4 are true.
8. -3 -2 1: This clause is satisfied if variables 3 and 2 are false, or if variable 1 is true.
9. 5 -3 1: This clause is satisfied if variables 5 and 3 are true, and variable 1 is false.
10. -2 5 -4: This clause is satisfied if either variable 2 is false, or if variables 5 and 4 are false.
11. 5 2 -3: This clause is satisfied if variables 5 and 2 are true, and variable 3 is false.
12. 1 -2 4: This clause is satisfied if variables 1 and 4 are true, and variable 2 is false.

Combining all these conditions, we can see that the solution that satisfies all the clauses is:
- Variable 1 is true
- Variable 2 is false
- Variable 3 is false
- Variable 4 is true
- Variable 5 is true

Therefore, the solution is:
answer: 1 -2 -3 4 5
