To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we first need to convert the DIMACS format into a more readable format. The problem is represented by a set of 12 clauses involving 5 variables. Each line corresponds to a clause, with the numbers representing the variables and their negations.

The variables are:
1 - x1
2 - x2
3 - x3
4 - x4
5 - x5

Now, let's break down the clauses:

1. -3 5 -1 : (?x3 v x5 v ?x1)
2. 4 5 -1 : (x4 v x5 v ?x1)
3. 5 2 -1 : (x5 v x2 v ?x1)
4. 5 -4 -3 : (x5 v ?x4 v ?x3)
5. -1 2 5 : (?x1 v x2 v x5)
6. 5 2 -4 : (x5 v x2 v ?x4)
7. -1 2 -4 : (?x1 v x2 v ?x4)
8. 3 -1 2 : (x3 v ?x1 v x2)
9. -1 -3 -2 : (?x1 v ?x3 v ?x2)
10. -1 -3 -4 : (?x1 v ?x3 v ?x4)
11. -1 5 2 : (?x1 v x5 v x2)
12. -4 -3 5 : (?x4 v ?x3 v x5)

We can see that the clauses are a combination of AND and OR logical operations.

Now, let's try to find a solution that satisfies all the clauses:

1. Let's assume:
x1 = FALSE
x2 = FALSE
x3 = FALSE
x4 = FALSE
x5 = TRUE

If we substitute these values into the clauses, we can see that all the clauses are satisfied. Therefore, the solution that satisfies all the clauses is:
x1 = FALSE
x2 = FALSE
x3 = FALSE
x4 = FALSE
x5 = TRUE

Final Answer: 
answer: x1 = FALSE, x2 = FALSE, x3 = FALSE, x4 = FALSE, x5 = TRUE
