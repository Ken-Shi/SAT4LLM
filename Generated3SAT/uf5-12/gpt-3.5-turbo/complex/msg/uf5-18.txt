To solve this problem, we need to find a satisfying assignment that makes all the clauses true. Here is the given problem in DIMACS format:

p cnf 5 12
-4 1 3 0
-5 4 3 0
-4 2 -5 0
4 3 5 0
1 3 2 0
-2 -5 4 0
4 3 1 0
4 5 -3 0
2 -5 4 0
1 -5 4 0
3 5 2 0
-2 4 1 0

Now, let's analyze each line of the problem:

1. -4 1 3: Either 4 is false, 1 is true, or 3 is true
2. -5 4 3: Either 5 is false, or 4 is true, or 3 is true
3. -4 2 -5: Either 4 is false, or 2 is true, or 5 is false
4. 4 3 5: Either 4 is true, 3 is true, or 5 is true
5. 1 3 2: Either 1 is true, 3 is true, or 2 is true
6. -2 -5 4: Either 2 is false, 5 is false, or 4 is true
7. 4 3 1: Either 4 is true, 3 is true, or 1 is true
8. 4 5 -3: Either 4 is true, 5 is true, or 3 is false
9. 2 -5 4: Either 2 is true, 5 is false, or 4 is true
10. 1 -5 4: Either 1 is true, 5 is false, or 4 is true
11. 3 5 2: Either 3 is true, 5 is true, or 2 is true
12. -2 4 1: Either 2 is false, 4 is true, or 1 is true

Based on the analysis above, one of the possible satisfying assignments is:
1. 4 is true
2. 5 is false
3. 1 is true
4. 2 is true
5. 3 is true

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: 4 -5 1 2 3
