To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use the following steps:

1. Initialize the variables:
    - There are 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

2. Translate the clauses:
    - (5 -4 -3) translates to (5 or not 4 or not 3)
    - (2 4 -1) translates to (2 or 4 or not 1)
    - (-5 3 -1) translates to (not 5 or 3 or not 1)
    - ...

3. Use logical deduction to simplify the clauses:
    - From clause (2 4 -1) we can determine that variable 1 must be False because if it were True, the clause would be satisfied, so -1.
    - From clause (-4 -5 -3) we can determine that variable 5 must be False because if it were True, the clause would be satisfied, so -5.
    - From clause (-3 -4 -1) we can determine that variable 2 must be True because if it were False, the clause would be satisfied, so 2.
    - From clause (-4 -2 -3) we can determine that variable 4 must be False because if it were True, the clause would be satisfied, so -4.
    
4. Simplified clauses:
    - (-1)
    - (2 4)
    - (-5 3 -1)
    - (-4 -5 -3)
    - (-1 -4 2)
    - (-4 -2 -1)
    - (2 -1 -5)

5. Find the assignment that satisfies all clauses:
    - Setting 1 to False, -1
    - Setting 2 to True, 2
    - Setting 3 to True, 3
    - Setting 4 to False, -4
    - Setting 5 to False, -5

Therefore, the solution is:
answer: 2 -1 3 -4 -5
