To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to analyze each clause and see if there is a consistent assignment of truth values that satisfies all clauses. 

The clauses are as follows:
1. (-1 OR -5 OR -3)
2. (4 OR -1 OR -5)
3. (-1 OR 3 OR -5)
4. (2 OR -5 OR -1)
5. (2 OR -1 OR -3)
6. (-2 OR 4 OR -3)
7. (5 OR 2 OR -1)
8. (-3 OR 2 OR -5)
9. (2 OR -1 OR -3)
10. (2 OR -3 OR -5)
11. (-3 OR 2 OR -5)
12. (-5 OR -1 OR 4)

After considering the clauses, we can assign the following truth values to the variables to satisfy all clauses:
1. -1
2. 4
3. 3
4. 2
5. N/A (can be any value)
6. -2
7. 5
8. N/A (can be any value)
9. N/A (can be any value)
10. N/A (can be any value)

Therefore, a solution to this SAT problem is:
answer: -1, -2, 3, 4, 5
