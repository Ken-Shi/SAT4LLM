To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use the following steps:
1. Initialize a truth assignment for the variables.
2. Read the DIMACS format to build the clauses.
3. Apply the truth assignment to the clauses and check if there is a satisfying assignment.

Given DIMACS format:
p cnf 5 12
-1 2 3 0
3 -4 -5 0
-1 -5 -2 0
-2 -5 -4 0
-2 1 -5 0
-4 -2 -1 0
-1 -5 -2 0
3 -1 -2 0
-3 -1 -4 0
-5 -1 -4 0
-2 -1 -3 0
-2 4 -3 0

The variables are:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

The clauses are: 
Clause 1: (-1 v 2 v 3)
Clause 2: (3 v -4 v -5)
Clause 3: (-1 v -5 v -2)
Clause 4: (-2 v -5 v -4)
Clause 5: (-2 v 1 v -5)
Clause 6: (-4 v -2 v -1)
Clause 7: (-1 v -5 v -2)
Clause 8: (3 v -1 v -2)
Clause 9: (-3 v -1 v -4)
Clause 10: (-5 v -1 v -4)
Clause 11: (-2 v -1 v -3)
Clause 12: (-2 v 4 v -3)

Let's apply the truth assignment to these clauses to determine if there is a satisfying assignment:
- If a clause has at least one true literal, the clause is satisfied.
- If all literals in a clause are false, the clause is not satisfied.

After applying the truth assignment, we see that the following assignment satisfies all the clauses:
1. False
2. True
3. True
4. False
5. False

Therefore, the satisfying assignment is:
answer: -1, 2, 3, -4, -5
