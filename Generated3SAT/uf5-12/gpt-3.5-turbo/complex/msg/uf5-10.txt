To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use a SAT solver:

Line of thoughts:
- The first number after "p cnf" indicates the number of variables (5 in this case).
- The second number after "p cnf" indicates the number of clauses (12 in this case).
- Each line after "p cnf" represents a clause, with the numbers corresponding to the literals. The last number in each line is always 0.
- A literal is represented by a number, with the negative sign indicating negation. For example, -3 means "not 3".
- The goal is to find an assignment of true/false values to the variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) that satisfies all the clauses.

Final answer:
answer: The SAT problem is satisfiable.
One possible solution is:
1=true, 2=false, 3=false, 4=false, 5=true
