To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to interpret the clauses provided and find a satisfying assignment if one exists.

The DIMACS format indicates that there are 5 variables and 12 clauses in this problem.

Now, let's analyze each clause one by one:

1. -5 2 -4 : This clause is satisfied if 5 is false, 2 is true, and 4 is false.
2. -5 2 1 : This clause is satisfied if 5 is false, 2 is true, and 1 is true.
3. -2 -4 -5 : This clause is satisfied if 2 is false, 4 is false, and 5 is false.
4. -3 -4 -2 : This clause is satisfied if 3 is false, 4 is false, and 2 is false.
5. -5 -2 -4 : This clause is satisfied if 5 is false, 2 is false, and 4 is false.
6. 1 -4 -5 : This clause is satisfied if 1 is true, 4 is false, and 5 is false.
7. -5 -4 1 : This clause is satisfied if 5 is false, 4 is false, and 1 is true.
8. -3 2 -5 : This clause is satisfied if 3 is false, 2 is true, and 5 is false.
9. 5 -4 2 : This clause is satisfied if 5 is true, 4 is false, and 2 is true.
10. 1 2 -4 : This clause is satisfied if 1 is true, 2 is true, and 4 is false.
11. 4 -3 2 : This clause is satisfied if 4 is true, 3 is false, and 2 is true.
12. 4 1 -3 : This clause is satisfied if 4 is true, 1 is true, and 3 is false.

Based on the analysis above, we can see that the clauses can be simultaneously satisfied with the following assignment:
1=true, 2=true, 3=false, 4=true, 5=false

Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:
answer: 1=true, 2=true, 3=false, 4=true, 5=false
