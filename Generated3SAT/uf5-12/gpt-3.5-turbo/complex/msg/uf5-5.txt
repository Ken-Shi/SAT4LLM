To solve the SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we first need to convert the clauses into a more readable form. The clauses are as follows:

1. (~x4 v x1 v ~x3)
2. (x5 v ~x2 v ~x3)
3. (~x2 v ~x4 v ~x3)
4. (~x3 v x1 v ~x4)
5. (~x4 v ~x1 v ~x2)
6. (~x4 v x5 v ~x2)
7. (~x3 v x5 v x4)
8. (~x3 v x5 v x1)
9. (x1 v ~x2 v x5)
10. (x3 v x1 v ~x2)
11. (~x3 v x1 v ~x4)
12. (~x4 v ~x2 v ~x5)

Now, let's try to simplify and solve the problem:

1. From clause 4, we have x3 = 1
2. From clause 8, we have x5 = 1
3. Substituting the values in clause 7, we get (1 v 1 v 1), which is always true
4. Therefore, the solution is x3 = 1, x5 = 1

answer: x3 = 1, x5 = 1
