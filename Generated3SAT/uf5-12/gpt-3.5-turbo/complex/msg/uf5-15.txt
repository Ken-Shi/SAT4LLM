To solve this problem, we need to find a satisfying assignment of truth values to the 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) that satisfies all 12 clauses given in DIMACS format.

Let's go through the clauses:
1. (1, -3, -4): At least one of 1, -3, -4 must be true.
2. (3, 2, -1): At least one of 3, 2, -1 must be true.
3. (-1, -4, 3): At least one of -1, -4, 3 must be true.
4. (-3, 2, -1): At least one of -3, 2, -1 must be true.
5. (3, -4, 2): At least one of 3, -4, 2 must be true.
6. (-1, 3, 5): At least one of -1, 3, 5 must be true.
7. (5, -2, -4): At least one of 5, -2, -4 must be true.
8. (2, 4, -1): At least one of 2, 4, -1 must be true.
9. (3, 1, -2): At least one of 3, 1, -2 must be true.
10. (-1, -3, 5): At least one of -1, -3, 5 must be true.
11. (3, 2, -4): At least one of 3, 2, -4 must be true.
12. (3, -5, -1): At least one of 3, -5, -1 must be true.

Now, let's try to find a solution that satisfies all 12 clauses.
By examining the clauses, we can find that the following assignment satisfies all clauses:
1. 1 is true
2. 2 is true
3. 3 is true
4. 4 is false
5. 5 is false

Therefore, the satisfying assignment is:
1. 1 is true
2. 2 is true
3. 3 is true
4. 4 is false
5. 5 is false

answer: 1 2 3 -4 -5
