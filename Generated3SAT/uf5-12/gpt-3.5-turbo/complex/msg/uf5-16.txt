This SAT problem is encoded in DIMACS format with 5 variables and 12 clauses. We need to determine if there is a satisfying assignment that makes all the clauses true.

Let's analyze the clauses:
1. -1 3 -4: This clause can be satisfied by assigning values 1, 2, and 0 to variables 1, 3, and 4 respectively.
2. 2 -4 5: This clause can be satisfied by assigning values 2, 0, and 1 to variables 2, 4, and 5 respectively.
3. 4 5 -2: This clause can be satisfied by assigning values 1, 1, and 0 to variables 4, 5, and 2 respectively.
4. 4 -1 5: This clause can be satisfied by assigning values 1, 2, and 1 to variables 4, 1, and 5 respectively.
5. 4 5 1: This clause can be satisfied by assigning values 1, 1, and 1 to variables 4, 5, and 1 respectively.
6. 5 4 3: This clause can be satisfied by assigning values 1, 1, and 1 to variables 5, 4, and 3 respectively.
7. 4 3 1: This clause can be satisfied by assigning values 1, 1, and 1 to variables 4, 3, and 1 respectively.
8. 3 -1 5: This clause can be satisfied by assigning values 1, 2, and 1 to variables 3, 1, and 5 respectively.
9. 2 3 4: This clause can be satisfied by assigning values 2, 1, and 1 to variables 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
10. -4 5 1: This clause can be satisfied by assigning values 0, 1, and 1 to variables 4, 5, and 1 respectively.
11. 4 1 3: This clause can be satisfied by assigning values 1, 2, and 1 to variables 4, 1, and 3 respectively.
12. 4 1 3: This clause can be satisfied by assigning values 1, 2, and 1 to variables 4, 1, and 3 respectively.

Therefore, the satisfying assignment is:
1 = 2
2 = 2
3 = 1
4 = 1
5 = 1

answer: 2 2 1 1 1
