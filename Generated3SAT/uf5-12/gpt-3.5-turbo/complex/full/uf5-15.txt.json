(1, -3, -4): At least one of 1, -3, -4 must be true.\n2. (3, 2, -1): At least one of 3, 2, -1 must be true.\n3. (-1, -4, 3): At least one of -1, -4, 3 must be true.\n4. (-3, 2, -1): At least one of -3, 2, -1 must be true.\n5. (3, -4, 2): At least one of 3, -4, 2 must be true.\n6. (-1, 3, 5): At least one of -1, 3, 5 must be true.\n7. (5, -2, -4): At least one of 5, -2, -4 must be true.\n8. (2, 4, -1): At least one of 2, 4, -1 must be true.\n9. (3, 1, -2): At least one of 3, 1, -2 must be true.\n10. (-1, -3, 5): At least one of -1, -3, 5 must be true.\n11. (3, 2, -4): At least one of 3, 2, -4 must be true.\n12. (3, -5, -1): At least one of 3, -5, -1 must be true.\n\nNow, let's try to find a solution that satisfies all 12 clauses.\nBy examining the clauses, we can find that the following assignment satisfies all clauses:\n1. 1 is true\n2. 2 is true\n3. 3 is true\n4. 4 is false\n5. 5 is false\n\nTherefore, the satisfying assignment is:\n1. 1 is true\n2. 2 is true\n3. 3 is true\n4. 4 is false\n5. 5 is false\n\nanswer: 1 2 3 -4 -5"
