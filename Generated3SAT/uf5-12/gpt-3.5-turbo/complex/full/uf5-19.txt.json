This means setting 5 to True does not work.\n\n- Now, let's try setting 5 to False:\n    - Since (NOT 5 OR NOT 1 OR 4) exists, we set 1 to False and 4 to True.\n    - Since (NOT 5 OR 3 OR NOT 2) exists, we set 2 to False and 3 to True.\n    - Since (2 OR 3 OR NOT 4) exists, we set 2 and 3 to True, which is consistent with our previous assignments.\n    - Since (4 OR 2 OR 3) exists, we set 4, 2, and 3 to True, which is consistent with our previous assignments.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n1 = False\n2 = True\n3 = True\n4 = True\n5 = False\n\nanswer: 2 -3 4 "
