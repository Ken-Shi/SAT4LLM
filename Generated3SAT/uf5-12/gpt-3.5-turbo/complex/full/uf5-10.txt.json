The last number in each line is always 0.\n- A literal is represented by a number, with the negative sign indicating negation. For example, -3 means \"not 3\".\n- The goal is to find an assignment of true/false values to the variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) that satisfies all the clauses.\n\nFinal answer:\nanswer: The SAT problem is satisfiable.\nOne possible solution is:\n1=true, 2=false, 3=false, 4=false, 5=true"
