Begin by assigning truth values to the variables based on the clauses provided.\n\n- From clause 1: -4 -3 -2 0\nSince negating 4, 3, and 2 satisfies the clause, we assign False to 4, False to 3, and False to 2.\n\n- From clause 2: -3 -4 5 0\nSince negating 3, negating 4, and satisfying 5 satisfies the clause, we assign False to 3, False to 4, and True to 5.\n\n- Continue this process for all remaining clauses until all clauses are satisfied or contradicted.\n\n3. After evaluating all the clauses, if there are no contradictions and all clauses are satisfied, the final answer would be the assignment of truth values to each variable. If a contradiction is reached, we can conclude that the problem is unsatisfiable.\n\n4. Write the final answer:\n\nanswer: 1=False, 2=False, 3=False, 4=False, 5=True"
