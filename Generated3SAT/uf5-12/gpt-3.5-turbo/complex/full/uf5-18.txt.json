Here is the given problem in DIMACS format:\n\np cnf 5 12\n-4 1 3 0\n-5 4 3 0\n-4 2 -5 0\n4 3 5 0\n1 3 2 0\n-2 -5 4 0\n4 3 1 0\n4 5 -3 0\n2 -5 4 0\n1 -5 4 0\n3 5 2 0\n-2 4 1 0\n\nNow, let's analyze each line of the problem:\n\n1. -4 1 3: Either 4 is false, 1 is true, or 3 is true\n2. -5 4 3: Either 5 is false, or 4 is true, or 3 is true\n3. -4 2 -5: Either 4 is false, or 2 is true, or 5 is false\n4. 4 3 5: Either 4 is true, 3 is true, or 5 is true\n5. 1 3 2: Either 1 is true, 3 is true, or 2 is true\n6. -2 -5 4: Either 2 is false, 5 is false, or 4 is true\n7. 4 3 1: Either 4 is true, 3 is true, or 1 is true\n8. 4 5 -3: Either 4 is true, 5 is true, or 3 is false\n9. 2 -5 4: Either 2 is true, 5 is false, or 4 is true\n10. 1 -5 4: Either 1 is true, 5 is false, or 4 is true\n11. 3 5 2: Either 3 is true, 5 is true, or 2 is true\n12. -2 4 1: Either 2 is false, 4 is true, or 1 is true\n\nBased on the analysis above, one of the possible satisfying assignments is:\n1. 4 is true\n2. 5 is false\n3. 1 is true\n4. 2 is true\n5. 3 is true\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nanswer: 4 -5 1 2 3"
