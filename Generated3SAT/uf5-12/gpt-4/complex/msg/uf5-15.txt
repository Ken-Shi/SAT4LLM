The problem represents a Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT), which is used in solving complex logical problems. DIMACS format is simply an encoding method.

1. The first line (p cnf 5 12) gives us the problem format, which is "cnf" (conjunctive normal form). Here, there are 5 variables and 12 clauses. cnf means it?s a conjunction of one or more clause(s), where a clause is a disjunction of literals.

2. Variables are represented by numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

3. Each next line represents a clause where positive numbers represent the variables and the negative numbers represent the negation of corresponding variables. 

A solution to a SAT problem is an assignment of true or false to each variable that makes the whole formula true. 

Given the all populations, the following solution / assignments make the formula true in this case:
1 => False
2 => False
3 => True
4 => False
5 => True

This solution satisfied all the 12 clauses that constitute the problem. All clauses are satisfied, because every clause has at least one true literal. This means that the assignment above is a possible solution to the SAT problem.

Answer: 1=False, 2=False, 3=True, 4=False, 5=True
