This is a problem of Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) represented in the DIMACS format. Which means we have five boolean variables and a total of twelve clauses that these variables need to satisfy. The goal is to find a pattern that solves this problem. Automatically, this problem can be solved using a SAT solver, but I can explain the concept of how to manually solve this problem through an example.

The DIMACS CNF format has each row end with 0 and each row represents a clause. A clause is a disjunction of literals, where a literal is a variable or the negation of a variable. If a number has a negative sign, it means the clause needs the boolean variable to be False for it to be satisfied. If a number is positive, it indicates the clause needs that variable to be True.

Let's try to solve this problem with the following assignments of variables. With enough experience, one could see that a good starting point for this problem is -4 false, -1 true, -2 true, 3 false and 5 true. That is, set 1, 2, and 5 as True and 3, 4 as False.

Check each clause in order to verify if they are satisfied by our chosen values:
- -4 1 -3 0, it is satisfied by 1 (true).
- 5 -2 -3 0, it is satisfied by 5 (true).
- -2 -4 -3 0, it is satisfied by -2 (true).
- -3 1 -4 0, it is satisfied by 1 (true).
- -4 -1 -2 0, it is satisfied by -1 (true).
- -4 5 -2 0, it is satisfied by 5 (true).
- -3 5 4 0, it is satisfied by 5 (true).
- -3 5 1 0, it is satisfied by 5 (true).
- 1 -2 5 0, it is satisfied by 1 (true).
- 3 1 -2 0, it is satisfied by 1 (true).
- -3 1 -4 0, it is satisfied by 1 (true).
- -4 -2 -5 0, it is satisfied by -2 (true).

As you can see, with this configuration all clauses are satisfied so this is a possible solution for the SAT problem.

answer: {1: True, 2: True, 3: False, 4: False, 5: True}
