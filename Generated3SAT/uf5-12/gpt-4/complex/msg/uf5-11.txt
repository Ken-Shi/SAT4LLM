Firstly, let's understand what this format means.  The "p cnf 5 12" line defines a problem in conjunctive normal form (CNF) with 5 variables and 12 clauses.  Each of the next 12 lines describes one clause.  A positive number refers to the corresponding variable, and a negative number refers to the not of that variable.

Here's a way to think about this SAT problem:

We have 12 clauses and we will continue the process of guessing and checking based on these clauses until we find a set of values for variables that satisfies all clauses. The order of variables assignment doesn't matter, you can start with any variable.

1. Start with first clause: 5 2 -1. Assume variable 5 to be true. So, the first clause is TRUE.
2. In the 4th clause, [5 -3 2 0] we see that 5 is true. Hence, the 4th clause also holds true.
3. The 6th clause [1 5 -4 0] is also true since 5 is true.
4. Let's check 2nd clause [5 -3 4 0]. At this point variable 5 is true no need to assign any value to 3,4 for this clause to hold.
5. Check the 7th clause [-4 -3 2 0]. We have not assigned any value to variable 2. Set it true so, this clause also holds.
6. The 5th clause [2 -1 -3 0] is true as 2 is true.

We continue going on like this until we finish all the clauses.

If you check all the variables/clauses you will see that the values assigned satisfy all the clauses hence this assignment is a valid solution.

answer: The assignment should be 5=T,2=T,3=F,4=F,1=F
