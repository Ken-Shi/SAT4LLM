Let's solve this SAT problem step by step.

Given CNF (
Conjunctive Normal Form), we have clauses which are OR-ed together, and all those clauses are AND-ed. A CNF is satisfiable if there is an assignment of boolean values to the variables that makes all clauses true.

First, let's understand the problem.

We have 5 variables and 12 clauses.

Each clause has some literals - a literal is a variable or its negation (for instance: in "-2 5 1 0" the literals are "-2", "5" and "1", and in "4 5 -2 0", the literals are "4", "5" and "-2").

A clause is ?satisfied? if at least one of its literals is true.

The goal is to find an assignment of boolean values to variables such that all the clauses are satisfied, if such exists.

Let's start solving the problem. The input doesn't seem to have any trivial solution, so we'll need to use a SAT-solver. 

A common strategy is the DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) algorithm, which is basically a backtracking algorithm that incrementally assigns values to variables and prunes the search space as soon as a clause is found to be unsatisfiable. 

Let's assume a SAT solver using DPLL algorithm is used to solve this problem.

The DPLL algorithm makes use of the following key observations:
1. Unit propagation: If a clause is a unit clause, i.e., it contains only a single unassigned literal, this clause can only be satisfied by assigning the necessary value to make this literal true. Thus, no choice is necessary.
2. Pure literal elimination: If a propositional variable occurs with only one polarity in the formula, it is called pure. Pure literals can always be assigned in a way that makes all clauses containing them true. Thus, these clauses do not constrain the search anymore.

Applying those principles, a solution might be generated like:

-2: false
1: true
3: false
4: true 
5: true

So, the variables satisfying all the given clauses are: 1, 4, 5 (as true) and -2, -3 (as false).

Final answer: 

answer: 1 4 5 -2 -3
