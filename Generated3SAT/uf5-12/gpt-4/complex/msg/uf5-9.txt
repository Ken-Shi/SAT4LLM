The given problem is in DIMACS format, which is the standard format for describing SAT problems. Each clause in the problem is described by a row, and the end of each clause is marked by a 0. The variables in the clauses are denoted by positive integers, and their negations by negative integers. For example, in the clause "1 -3 -4 0", the variables are 1, 3 and 4, where 1 is true and 3, 4 are false.

Moreover, the first line "p cnf 5 12" specifies that this is a propositional logic formula in conjunctive normal form, there are 5 variables and 12 clauses.

The steps to solve the SAT problem are:

1. Start with all variables being undefined.
2. Find the easiest clause (the one with least undefined literals). In case of a tie, we look for the clause with the most positive literals. For instance, start with the clause '1 -3 -4 0'. We assign 1 to true that satisfies this clause.
3. Repeat the process. Then, we can go with clause '5 -2 -4 0'. We assign 5 to true to satisfy this clause.
4. Continue with the next clause '2 -3 5 0'. Since 5 is already true, this clause is satisfied regardless of the value of 2 and 3. Similarly, '-2 -3 5 0' is also satisfied.
5. Then, consider the clause '5 1 -4 0'. It has already been satisfied with 1 and 5 assigned to true. 
6. For '1 -3 -2 0', we assign -2 to true that satisfies this clause.
7. Next, '-4 1 -2 0' is satisfied because 1 and -2 are true.
8. For '1 -3 4 0', it already satisfies with 1 being true.
9. Finally, for '2 -4 -3 0', we can set either 2 or -3 to true. Let's choose 2 for simplicity.

We do not need to specifically satisfy the clauses '5 -4 -2 0', '1 -2 -4 0', '1 -3 -4 0', and '2 -4 -3 0' because they have already been satisfied by our previous assignments.

Answer: 1 = true, 2 = true, 3 = undefined, 4 = undefined, 5 = true
