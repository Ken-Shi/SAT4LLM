In this SAT problem, we begin by identifying variables and their clauses:

1. Variable 1 is found in clauses: {4,1,-5}, {2,-1,3}, {-1,-5,2}, {-3,-1,4}, {1,-4,2}, and {-5,4,1}.
2. Variable 2 is found in clauses: {2,-1,3}, {-1,-5,2}, {2,-1,-5}, {2,1,-4}, {1,-4,2}, {-1,-3,2}, {-5,1,2}, {2,4,-3}, and {-4,-5,2}.
3. Variable 3 is found in clauses: {2,-1,3}, {-3,-1,4}, and {2,4,-3}.
4. Variable 4 is found in clauses: {4,1,-5}, {2,1,-4}, {-3,-1,4}, {1,-4,2}, {-5,4,1}, and {-4,-5,2}.
5. Variable 5 is found in clauses: {4,1,-5}, {-1,-5,2}, {2,-1,-5}, {-5,1,2}, and{-5,4,1}.

Looking at the clauses, Variable 5 stands out because every clause it appears in also contains Variable 1. This suggests that we can assign positive to Variable 5 or Variable 1 in order to satisfy these clauses, without unsatisfying other clauses that contain them.

Let's assign true to Variable 5 and false to Variable 1.

Then, satisfy clause {2,1,-4} we need to assign true to Variable 2 and Variable 4.

Similarly, given that Variable 4 is true, the only way to satisfy clause {-3,-1,4} is to make Variable 3 false.

Finally, there is a contradiction in the variable 2 where it needs to be true in the clause {2,4,-3} but false in the clause {-1,-3,2}. So there is no assignment of values to the variables that can make all clauses in the given formula true. This implies that the formula is unsatisfiable.

Answer: UNSATISFIABLE
