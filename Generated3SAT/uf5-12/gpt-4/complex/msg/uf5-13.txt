This problem is a conjunctive normal form problem, and each line from the second line onwards represents a clause with either the variable or its negation. Each variable can be either true or false, represented by 1 or 0 respectively. The 0 at the end of each line does not represent a variable value, it just marks the end of the clause.

The task here is to find a valuation of variables that makes the whole formula (the conjunction of all clauses) true. 

Let's interpret these clauses:

-1 5 -3 0 => not x1 or x5 or not x3
2 -3 -5 0 => x2 or not x3 or not x5
5 -2 -3 0 => x5 or not x2 or not x3
-2 5 4 0 => not x2 or x5 or x4
-3 -2 4 0 => not x3 or not x2 or x4
-2 5 4 0 => not x2 or x5 or x4
-2 -3 4 0 => not x2 or not x3 or x4
-2 -3 4 0 => not x2 or not x3 or x4
-3 4 -1 0 => not x3 or x4 or not x1
-1 5 -3 0 => not x1 or x5 or not x3
-3 5 -1 0 => not x3 or x5 or not x1
-1 -2 5 0 => not x1 or not x2 or x5

Let's propose a solution for this problem:

If we set x1 = 0 (false), x2 = 0 (false), x3 = 1 (true), x4 = 1 (true), x5 = 1 (true).

This assignment makes all clauses true and hence the conjunction of all clauses true.

Answer: x1 = 0, x2 = 0, x3 = 1, x4 = 1, x5 = 1.
