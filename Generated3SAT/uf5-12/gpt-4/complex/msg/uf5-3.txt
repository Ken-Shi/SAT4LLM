In order to solve this SAT problem, we will use the approach of the DPLL (Davis, Putnam, Logemann, and Loveland) algorithm, which is a popular method to solve SAT problems. The main steps are choosing a literal, setting it to "true", simplifying the formula accordingly, and then recurse. If we hit a contradiction, we backtrack and set the literal to "false", and then simplify and recurse again.

Let's start choosing the literal randomly from the clauses, for example, the literal 5 from the first clause:

We set 5 to be "true". 

Now, we can simplify the formula by removing every clause containing the literal 5 (since they will evaluate to "true" regardless of the other literals in the clause), and remove the negation of the literal -5 from all the other clauses where it appears.

After applying these simplification steps, the formula becomes:

-4 3 0
-1 -2 -4 0
-2 4 1 0
-2 3 4 0
2 3 0
-2 1 0
3 -2 4 0
4 -2 0

Now, choosing the literal 1 from the fourth clause, and repeating the steps:

1 is set to be "true"

The formula is simplified and becomes:

-4 3 0
-2 4 0
2 3 0
-2 0
3 -2 4 0
4 -2 0

Now, choosing the literal 2 from the third clause:

2 is set to be "true"

The formula now becomes:

-4 3 0
-2 4 0
3 0
4 0

Now, choosing the literal 4 from the second clause:

4 is set to be "true"

After simplifying, we get:

-3 0
3 0

Now, choosing the literal 3 from the first clause:

3 is set to be "true"

After simplifying, no more clauses are left.

The final assignment that satisfies the original SAT problem is:

Answer: 5=true, 1=true, 2=true, 4=true, 3=true

NOTE: The SAT problem is typically defined such that every clause must have at least one literal that is "true", but each literal can be either "true" or "false" without affecting the other literals. The solution is a possible satisfying assignment for the given formula. The solution not necessarily will be unique, since SAT problems can potentially have multiple satisfying assignments.
