To solve this 3-SAT problem, we can use an algorithm such as the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm along with assignment of literals based on appearance frequencies and pure literal rule.

A SAT problem is aimed at finding a set of truth values for a number of variables that make a clause true. For the DIMACS format, each row represents a clause, whereas each integer corresponds to a literal except for the 0 which indicates the end of a clause, numbers are either positive or negative depending on the sign, if it's negative, then the literal is negated.

For the first step, we examine the clauses to identify pure literals, which are literals that occur with the same polarization. We don't have any pure literals with respect to this problem. 

Next we look into the frequency of literals, we see that 2 and -3 are the most frequent. Let's start by setting 2 to true and -3 to false (#2 is true, #3 is false).

Now we apply unit propagation, simplifying the clauses wherever possible based on these assignments, this allows multiple clauses to be removed since they are fulfilled or they contain -3.

Remaining clauses after assigning #2 as true and #3 as false:
4 0
5 0
-4 -5 0
-4 0
5 -4 0
-4 5 0
-5 -1 0

Next, let's assign #4 as true and -1 as false (#4 is true, #1 is false). Simplifying the clauses after the assignment, we have:

5 0
-5 0
5 0
5 0
-5 0

Now we assign #5 as true. With this assignment, all the clauses are satisfied. So the solution to the problem is #2 = true, #3 = false, #4 = true, #1 = false and #5 = true.

Answer: 1 -1, 2 1, 3 -1, 4 1, 5 1
