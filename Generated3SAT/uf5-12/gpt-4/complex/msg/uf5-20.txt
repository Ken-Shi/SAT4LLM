The given problem is in DIMACS format which is a standard format for specifying satisfiability (SAT) problems. Each line here represents a clause, and the variables are represented by numbers. The negation of a variable is represented by the preceding -. For instance, "2 -1 -3 0" corresponds to the clause (x2 OR NOT x1 OR NOT x3).

Let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's look for pure literals (i.e., a variable that is either always positive or always negative in all clauses). Here, we can find that 2, 4 and 5 are pure literals, and hence must be true. Also, -1 and -3 are pure literals and hence must be false. We already have 3 partial assignments: x2=true, x4=true, x5=true, x1=false, x3=false.

Step 2: After simplifying the clauses with the partial assignment from step 1, we have no remaining clauses, because they are all trivially satisfied. 

Given the absence of further restrictions, the variable assignments from step 1 are our solutions. Therefore:

answer: x1=False, x2=True, x3=False, x4=True, x5=True.
