This is a problem from SAT where we are given a set of clauses, each clause consists of literals, and we are looking for an assignment of variables that makes all the clauses true. 

The given SAT problem is already in conjunctive normal form (CNF), mentioned by `p cnf 5 12` where 5 is the number of variables and 12 is the number of clauses. All clauses are listed below it.  

Each clause after the CNF statement is ended by a 0 and the negative sign in front of a number represents the negation of that variable. 

Here is a solution which involves a step-by-step assigning of true/false values or 1/-1 values to each literal: 

A convenient way to start is to assign a value to variable 5, since it seems to appear most frequently (7 times). 

After assigning 5 = -1 (false), the resulting simplification leads to clauses:

1 4 0 
3 -2 0
-1 -2 -3 0
-2 -3 4 0
-2 -3 4 0
1 4 0 
4 1 0 
3 0 
4 -2 -3 0
-2 -3 0
1 0

After simplifying the clauses and ignoring identical clauses we get:

1 4 0 
3 -2 0
-1 -2 -3 0
-2 -3 4 0
3 0 
-2 -3 0
1 0

At this point, we see the clause "3 0", which means 3 must be true or all the formula would be false. So let's assign 3 = 1. 

After assigning 3 = 1 we get the list of clauses as follows :

1 4 0
-2 0
-2 4 0
-2 0
1 0

Solving the remaining clauses we can assign 1 = 1, 2 = -1 and 4 = -1. 

After translating the above assignments back to the form in which the original input was given, the solution is 1, -2, 3, -4, -5.

Answer: 1, -2, 3, -4, -5
