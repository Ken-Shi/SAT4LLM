The given problem is in the Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) used in SAT problems. This format represents a Boolean formula, where each line after "p cnf 5 12" represents a clause. The numbers represent literals, and a negative sign '-' in front of a number represents the logical NOT of that literal. A '0' at the end of each line separates the clauses.

Here is a quick breakdown of the clauses into more readable format: 

1.  Not-1 OR 2 OR 3
2.  3 OR Not-4 OR Not-5
3.  Not-1 OR Not-5 OR Not-2
4.  Not-2 OR Not-5 OR Not-4
5.  Not-2 OR 1 OR Not-5
6.  Not-4 OR Not-2 OR Not-1
7.  Not-1 OR Not-5 OR Not-2 (same as clause 3)
8.  3 OR Not-1 OR Not-2
9.  Not-3 OR Not-1 OR Not-4
10. Not-5 OR Not-1 OR Not-4
11. Not-2 OR Not-1 OR Not-3
12. Not-2 OR 4 OR Not-3

We can solve this problem using Boolean satisfiability solvers (SAT solvers). These solvers use several sophisticated techniques like backtracking search, unit propagation, pure literal elimination, and clause learning. 

However, given the size of our problem, we could manually find a solution using a systematic and simplified method. We can observe the clauses and look for a literal that always appears with the same polarity, which might give us some good first assignments to try. 

Here, we can see that '1' only appears as 'Not-1':
- Not-1 OR 2 OR 3
- Not-1 OR Not-5 OR Not-2
- Not-2 OR 1 OR Not-5
- Not-4 OR Not-2 OR Not-1
- Not-1 OR Not-5 OR Not-2
- 3 OR Not-1 OR Not-2
- Not-3 OR Not-1 OR Not-4
- Not-5 OR Not-1 OR Not-4
- Not-2 OR Not-1 OR Not-3

This indicates that assigning '1' to false would make our work easier. Assigning '1' to false, we can eliminate 'Not-1' from all the clauses. Then we will update the rest of the clauses accordingly. 

This kind of logical analysis continues until we either find a satisfying assignment (all clauses satisfied) or every possible assignment is explored and proven to lead to a conflict.
