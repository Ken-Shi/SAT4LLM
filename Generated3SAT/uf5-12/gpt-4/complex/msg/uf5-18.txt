First, let's explore what the problem is asking. This is a SAT(orary logic) problem where 5 represents the total number of variables(x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5), and 12 is the total number of clauses. Each line after 'p cnf 5 12' is a clause where a variable's sign is positive if it is not negated and negative if it is negated. ending '0' in each clause denotes the end of each clause.

First we will list out the 12 clauses: 

1) -x4 OR x1 OR x3 
2) -x5 OR x4 OR x3 
3) -x4 OR x2 OR -x5 
4) x4 OR x3 OR x5 
5) x1 OR x3 OR x2 
6) -x2 OR -x5 OR x4 
7) x4 OR x3 OR x1 
8) x4 OR x5 OR -x3 
9) x2 OR -x5 OR x4 
10) x1 OR -x5 OR x4 
11) x3 OR x5 OR x2 
12) -x2 OR x4 OR x1 

Next, we start analyzing the clauses to find a consistent assignment of truths that will satisfy all the clauses. We can derive the following facts from the list of clauses:

Since (1) includes -x4 and (4) includes x4, we know that one of x1, x3 and x5 must be true.

Since (2) includes -x5 and (8) includes x5, we know that one of x3, x4 and x1 must be true.

Since (3) includes -x4 and (4) includes x4, we know that one of x2 and x5 must be true.

From (6) and (9), we can decide that either -x5 or x4 must be true, but clause (4) has x4 OR x3 OR x5, which means x4 is false then either x3 or x5 must be true but again from (2) since -x5 is there x3 must be true.

From clauses 7, 1 and 10 we can infer that x1= true.

From clauses 7 and 9 x4 must be true. 

From clauses 11 and 4 x2 must be false and based on (3) we have x5 is true.

So, final values are 

x1= true 
x2= false
x3= true 
x4= true 
x5= true 

Answer: 1 -2 3 4 5
