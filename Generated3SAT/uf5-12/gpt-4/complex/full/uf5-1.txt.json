This problem is choosing an assignment of truth values for each variable in such a way that all the given clauses are satisfied.\n\nBy looking at the problem, if we set the 'x5' (5) to 'False', the first three clauses are violated, hence 'x5' (5) is 'True'.\n\nAlso, from clause '5 -4 -3 0', either 'x4' (4) or 'x3' (3) must be 'False' to satisfy this clause. \n\nBut looking at the clause '4 5 -1 0', since 'x5' (5) is 'True', this statement can only be satisfied if 'x4' (4) is 'True', hence 'x3' (3) must be 'False'.\n\nNext, from the clause '3 -1 2 0', since 'x3' is 'False', for this to hold 'x2' (2) must be 'True'.\n\nFinally, for the last clause ' -4 -3 5 0', since 'x5' (5) is 'True', 'x4' (4) is 'True', and 'x3' (3) is 'False', this clause already holds, so no additional assignments are needed.\n\nTherefore, the variable assignments 'x1' (1) can be 'Either True or False', 'x2' (2) is 'True', 'x3' (3) is 'False', 'x4' (4) is 'True', and 'x5' (5) is 'True' will satisfy all given clauses.\n\nAnswer: 1 -1/1, 2 1, 3 -1, 4 1, 5 1"
