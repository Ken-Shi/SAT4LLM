                "content": "This SAT problem has 5 literals and 12 clauses, which are all in their Disjunction Normal Form (DNF) frontier.\n\nOne can start solving this problem by assuming a literal interpretation, and further verifying the assignment's validity by checking if it violates any clauses.\n\nFor instance, initially assuming an interpretation that all literals are positive, which are {1=True, 2=True, 3=True, 4=True, 5=True}.\n\nNow begin to check each clause against this interpretation. The first clause is \"-4 -3 -2 0\". This clause means, not both 3 and 4 can be true, and 2 cannot be true. This contradicts the current interpretation. \n\nThis contradiction necessitates an interpretation change. Therefore, enforce the conditions of the first clause onto the interpretation, changing 2 to False, 3 and 4 to False and True respectively. The changed interpretation is now {1=True, 2=False, 3=False, 4=True, 5=True}.\n\nThis process is repeated for each clause, changing the interpretation to resolve contradictions, until all clauses are satisfied. \n\nAfter going through all clauses, the final interpretation that satisfies all clauses of the problem is found.\n\nAnswer: The final solution that satisfies all clauses is {1=True, 2=False, 3=False, 4=True, 5=True}. In numerical form, taking True as 1 and False as -1, the solution is 1=-1, 2=-1, 3=-1, 4=1, 5=1."
