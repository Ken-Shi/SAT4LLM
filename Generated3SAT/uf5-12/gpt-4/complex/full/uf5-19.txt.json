                "content": "The SAT problem is provided in DIMACS format, first we need to understand the format. Here, the first line specifies that there are 5 variables and 12 clauses in the problem. From second line onward, we have Clauses where each literal in the clause is separated by space. A negative sign in front of a variable denotes the negation of the variable. Each clause is terminated by \"0\". \n\nLet's start solving this:\nEach row describes a disjunction (OR) between literals, and the goal is to find a conjunction (AND) between all the clauses. \n\nWe have to find a combination of literals to make each clause true.\n\nFollowing is an example solution:\n\n1. Here, by inspection, clause 10 (\"-5 3 -2 0\") can make the clause true by setting variable 3 true.\n2. Given the value for variable 3, clause 7 (\"2 -3 1 0\") can become true by setting variable 2 true.\n3. With values for variable 2 and 3, clause 6 (\"2 3 -4 0\") can become true by setting variable 4 false.\n4. With these values, clause 1 (\"5 -4 3 0\") can become true by setting variable 5 true.\n5. Finally, with all other variable values, clause 5 (\"-5 -1 4 0\") can become true by setting variable 1 false.\n\nSo we could get a solution with variables as follows: \n1 - False\n2 - True\n3 - True\n4 - False\n5 - True\n\nSatisfiability problems are NP, so for very large inputs, a brute force approach could be taken by trying every possible combination of values and checking if it results in each clause being true.\n\nYou could also use a SAT solver to get the answers readily.\n\nAnswer:\n'1 - False, 2 - True, 3 - True, 4 - False, 5 - True'"
