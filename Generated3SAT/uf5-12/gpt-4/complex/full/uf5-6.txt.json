Variable 1 is found in clauses: {4,1,-5}, {2,-1,3}, {-1,-5,2}, {-3,-1,4}, {1,-4,2}, and {-5,4,1}.\n2. Variable 2 is found in clauses: {2,-1,3}, {-1,-5,2}, {2,-1,-5}, {2,1,-4}, {1,-4,2}, {-1,-3,2}, {-5,1,2}, {2,4,-3}, and {-4,-5,2}.\n3. Variable 3 is found in clauses: {2,-1,3}, {-3,-1,4}, and {2,4,-3}.\n4. Variable 4 is found in clauses: {4,1,-5}, {2,1,-4}, {-3,-1,4}, {1,-4,2}, {-5,4,1}, and {-4,-5,2}.\n5. Variable 5 is found in clauses: {4,1,-5}, {-1,-5,2}, {2,-1,-5}, {-5,1,2}, and{-5,4,1}.\n\nLooking at the clauses, Variable 5 stands out because every clause it appears in also contains Variable 1. This suggests that we can assign positive to Variable 5 or Variable 1 in order to satisfy these clauses, without unsatisfying other clauses that contain them.\n\nLet's assign true to Variable 5 and false to Variable 1.\n\nThen, satisfy clause {2,1,-4} we need to assign true to Variable 2 and Variable 4.\n\nSimilarly, given that Variable 4 is true, the only way to satisfy clause {-3,-1,4} is to make Variable 3 false.\n\nFinally, there is a contradiction in the variable 2 where it needs to be true in the clause {2,4,-3} but false in the clause {-1,-3,2}. So there is no assignment of values to the variables that can make all clauses in the given formula true. This implies that the formula is unsatisfiable.\n\nAnswer: UNSATISFIABLE"
