That's why set variable 2 = true is correct.\n\nNow let's find the other clauses that contain variable 3, finding that there are no contradictions so set variable 3 = false.\n\nCheck for variable 4 and found that 4 -5 1 0, this clause can also be satisfied when 4 = False, and all other clauses can also be satisfied.\n\nAs for variable 5, if 5 = true, then all clauses are satisfied since the clauses that contain variable 5 either positive and negative can be satisfied by setting the other variables. \n\nSo, we have found a solution.\n\n\nAnswer: 1=True, 2=True, 3=False, 4=False, 5=True."
