Each line that ends with 0 represents a disjunctive clause (the OR of literals).\n\nHere are the general steps I took:\n\n1. I looked for unit clauses (clauses with a single literal). There was no unit clause to start with.\n2. I checked for pure literals (literal that always appears with the same polarity). I found that literal 5 always appears positive, and literal 1 always appears negative.\n3. I assigned these pure literals their satisfying values: 5 = true, 1 = false.\n4. With these assignments, I was able to eliminate some clauses (those that contain literal 5) and some literals from the other clauses (all instances of literal 1).\n5. I repeated steps 1 and 2, looking again for unit clauses and pure literals in the simplified problem. Literal 4 became unit clause, so 4 = true.\n6. All clauses containing literal 4 became irrelevant. After removing those and the negative instances of 4, literals 2 and 3 were also found to be pure literals. Hence, 2 = true and 3 = true\n7. After the above assignments, there were no clauses left, which means all constraints are satisfied, so the problem is satisfiable with these assignments.\n\nAnswer: 1 = false, 2 = true, 3 = true, 4 = true, 5 = true."
