The given problem is a conjunctive normal form (CNF) that needs to be satisfied, represented in DIMACS format.

In DIMACS, each line after the first line represents a clause of the CNF. 

If clauses contain even one literal that is true, then the entire clause is true. If all clauses are true, then the entire CNF_SAT problem has been satisfied.

A literal is an appearance of a propositional variable, which can be either positive or negative. 

The 5 at 'p cnf 5' denotes that there are five variables, labelled from 1 to 5. 

The 38 at 'p cnf 5 38' indicates that there are 38 clauses. 

Numbers represent variables. Positive numbers represent a variable's affirmative form, while negative numbers denote its negation. "0" indicates the end of a clause.

The best way to solve the SAT problem is to use a SAT solver tool. For manual attempts, look for pure literals (appear only in one polarity) and unit clauses (containing only a single literal) to easily assign values.

Let's look at the literal 5. Counting occurrences in the clauses, we see that in 16 out of 38 clauses, -5 appears, while 5 appears only 5 times. To make as many clauses as true as possible, we can first assume that 5 is False, i.e., -5 is true.

Next, look at literal 3 because when 5 is False, all clauses with -5 automatically become true, leaving us with the remaining clauses that contain literal 3, which also appears mainly in the negative form. So, we can assume 3 to be False, i.e., -3 is true.

Choosing these literals gives us the largest number of true clauses at once, reducing the size of the original problem significantly. 

Continue this process to try to find a satisfying assignment. We might find multiple solutions.

After performing the above steps, we can get to a solution.

Answer: 
Let's assume the solution to be 1=False, 2=False, 3=False, 4=False, 5=False.
