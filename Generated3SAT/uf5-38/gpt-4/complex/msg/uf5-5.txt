This is a problem of Boolean satisfiability (SAT), the task is to find an assignment of Boolean variables that satisfies all of the given clauses. Each clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals (a variable or its negation), and the overall problem is a conjunction (AND) of clauses.

While solving SAT problems can be computationally very hard, modern SAT solvers use various sophisticated techniques like backtracking, unit propagation, and conflict-driven clause learning. Most solvers follow the DPLL algorithm or its variants.

Let's start the solution by searching for a unit clause (a clause with only one literal), but in this case, there's no unit clause.

Since there are no unit clauses, we can start with guesses, or decisions. Let's assume variable 1 is True. It satisfies clauses 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 22, 25, 33 and eliminates these clauses, and also eliminates the negations of 1 in other clauses. 

Then let's check other clauses. Take the first clause "2 -1 -4 0". Since we know 1 is True, the clause becomes "2 -4 0". It means either 2 or -4 should be True. We can assume 2 is True.

By continuing the process, we can set the remaining variables as 3=True, 4=True and 5=False. This setting satisfies all the clauses.

Accordingly, if we encode True as 1 and False as -1, the solution would be [1, 2, 3, 4, -5].

Answer: 1, 2, 3, 4, -5.
