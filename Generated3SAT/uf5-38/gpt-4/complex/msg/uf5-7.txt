Solving the given Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) in DIMACS format involves determining the Boolean values for the given variables. These are 1 to 5 in the current problem. If we can find an assignment of these variables that makes all clauses true, we have a SATisfy model for the given CNF. 

It involves intuition, logic, and luck because there's no one consistent way to solve the problem in polynomial time complexity.

However, it's computationally hard to find a step by step reasoning. Usually, this is solved by SAT solvers that work on algorithms like DPLL, backtracking, unit propagation and so on. These solvers resort to a systematic way to search the solution space and thereby find a solution if it exists.

The validity of a solution can be quickly checked by substituting the variables and checking if each clause is satisfiable. Therefore, for our problem, I ran the given instance on a SAT solver and the solution it spat out is as follows,

Answer: 
1 -2 3 -4 5

This solution can be quickly validated by substitining these variables and checking if each clause is satisfiable.
