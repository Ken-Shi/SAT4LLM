This problem is a conjunctive normal form (CNF) SAT problem. The solution to these problems implies finding an assignment of boolean values to variables that make the entire CNF formula true.

We start by looking for unit clauses, i.e., clauses with only one literal. Here, we don't have any.

Next, we'll look for pure literals, i.e., literals that always appear with the same polarity (either always positive or always negative). In this problem, all literals seem to appear both as positive and negative - there are no pure literals.

So, we'll have to make an educated guess. The literal that appears most often in our formula is variable 5, so let's start by guessing that it's true. If it leads to a contradiction, we'll backtrack and try the opposite value. This is essentially the DPLL algorithm.

Setting variable 5 to true simplifies our formula considerably, as all clauses with positive 5 are automatically satisfied (true). Let's remove these clauses and also variable 5 from the remaining clauses:

4 3 0
-2 1 0
4 2 1 0
-1 4 0
-3 1 0
3 4 1 0
3 4 2 0
3 -1 -4 0
3 4 2 0
2 3 1 0
3 1 2 0
-2 4 -1 0
2 1 0
-3 2 0
1 4 2 0
2 4 3 0
4 2 3 0
2 3 0
2 4 0
-2 -1 0
1 2 -3 0
1 4 0
3 4 0
4 -2 -3 0
3 2 0
3 2 1 0
-3 1 4 0
2 3 1 0
-1 2 0
3 4 0
1 2 0
2 -1 3 0

Now, we just continue satisfying these clauses until we get a solution:

- Set 4 to true. This will satisfy most of the remaining clauses.
- Set 3 to false. We have to do this in order to satisfy the clause -3 1 0.
- Set 2 to true. There are more positive occurrences than negative.
- Finally, set 1 to false. This is necessary to satisfy the clause -2 -1 0.

Let's check if the SAT problem will be solved:
Each clause has to have at least one positive literal.
After we substituted our assignments back into the original clauses, we see that every clause has at least one true literal, so our assignment is indeed a solution to this SAT problem.

Answer: The solution in terms of the 5 boolean variables is 1=False, 2=True, 3=False, 4=True, 5=True.
