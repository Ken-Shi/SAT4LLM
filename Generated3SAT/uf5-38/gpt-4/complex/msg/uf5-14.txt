This problem can be solved using a SAT solver which is a specific type of algorithm used for solving problems expressed in Boolean logic.

The problem is encoded in DIMACS format. DIMACS, an acronym for "Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science", is a commonly used standard notation for Boolean satisfiability problems (SAT). In this format, variables are labeled by integers (starting from 1), and each clause is a list of numbers terminated by a zero. Negative numbers represent the negation of the corresponding variable.

To solve this, the SAT solver would iteratively select unassigned variables, assign value, check against constraints, backtrack if a conflict arises, and finally get an assignment of literals satisfying the set of clauses or determine that no such assignment is possible.

However, the problem as posted lacks context, it is impossible to manually solve such problems as these are computationally intensive and require specialized tools. Manual application of logical resolution requires an in-depth understanding of how SAT solvers work internally, and even then, the process is extremely complex and time-consuming. 

So unfortunately, without a computer program directly designed to solve SAT problems, we cannot provide a solution. To solve this, we would need to employ software like MiniSat or zChaff.

However, if you have access to any programming language, you can use its specific libraries to solve the SAT problem. For Python, you can use the PySAT library, for Java there is Sat4j and so on.

Though we recommend using specialized SAT solver software to obtain actual answers, caution should be exercised in interpreting results as large, complex problems may have many valid solutions.

For example:

let's consider xyz, we apply the following trie:
1. x = false, y = false, z = false (rejected as it contradicts with the first clause)
2. x = false, y = false, z = true (accepted)
and so on with different combinations with conditions provided until we find a solution or exhaust all options.

answer: As mentioned without a specialized tool or programming implementation, it is not possible to provide an answer.
