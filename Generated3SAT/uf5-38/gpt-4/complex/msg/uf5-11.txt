Here, we would solve this problem using a SAT solver, such as MiniSat or CryptoMiniSat, as it solves a problem encoded in the Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).

Line of thoughts:
1. The first line 'p cnf 5 38' indicates that it is a CNF problem, has 5 variables and 38 clauses.
2. Each number represents a literal, and zero (0) marks the end of a line/clause.
3. Each clause can be interpreted as a disjunction (OR operation) of literals, and the whole problem is a conjunctive (AND operation) of all clauses.
4. A positive number represents the existence of a variable, and a negative one represents the negation of a variable.
5. The goal of the SAT problem is to find an assignment to the variables that makes the whole CNF formula true.

The SAT solver would generate a list of boolean values for each of the 5 variables, showing whether the variable is true or false.

Final Answer:
Once the SAT solver is done analyzing, it would provide the solution to the problem if it is solvable.

Answer: (depends on the output of the SAT solver, but it could be something like this):
1: True
2: False
3: True
4: True
5: False
