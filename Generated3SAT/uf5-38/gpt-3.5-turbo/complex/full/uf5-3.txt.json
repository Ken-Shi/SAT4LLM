The WalkSAT algorithm randomly flips the value of variables in an attempt to satisfy the given CNF formula. \n\nHere is the solution generated by WalkSAT after applying the algorithm to the given CNF formula:\n\n- x1 = True\n- x2 = True\n- x3 = True\n- x4 = False\n- x5 = True\n\nThis assignment satisfies all the clauses in the CNF formula, therefore it is the solution.\n\nFinal answer:\nanswer: 1 -2 3 -4 5"
