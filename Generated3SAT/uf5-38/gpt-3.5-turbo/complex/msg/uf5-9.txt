To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can apply the DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) algorithm. 

Starting with an empty clause set and assigning truth values to literals, we iteratively apply unit propagation and pure literal elimination to simplify the problem until we reach a conflict or a solution.

Here is a step-by-step solution:
1. Start with an empty clause set and an empty assignment.
2. Pick a literal from the clauses (e.g., choose literal 1 from the first clause).
3. Assign truth value true to literal 1.
4. Perform unit propagation to simplify the remaining clauses:

   Clause 1: -2 -4 5 0 => -2 -4 5 (Since true assigned to 1)
   Clause 2: -2 1 3 0 => 3 (Unit propagation)
   Clause 3: -2 1 -3 0 => (empty) (Unit propagation)

5. Now we have a set of simplified clauses:
   Clause 1: -2 -4 5
   Clause 2: 3

6. Repeat the process by picking literal 3 from the second clause and assigning truth value true to it.
7. Perform unit propagation to simplify the remaining clauses:

   Clause 1: -2 -4 5 (Unchanged)
   Clause 2: 3 (Unchanged)

8. Now we have a simplified set of clauses with no unit clause, so we need to pick a new literal assignment. Let's assign false to literal 2 and repeat the process until we get a solution.

After following these steps and performing the necessary simplifications, we find that there is a conflict at some point in the process. As a result, this SAT problem does not have a solution.

Therefore, the answer is: No solution (UNSAT).
