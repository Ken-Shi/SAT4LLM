To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment. The problem has 5 variables and 24 clauses.

Line of thoughts:
1. Input the clauses into the SAT solver in DIMACS format.
2. Let the SAT solver determine if there is a satisfying assignment for the given set of clauses.
3. If the SAT solver outputs a solution, interpret the variable assignments to satisfy all the clauses.

Final answer:
answer: The given SAT problem is satisfiable. One possible satisfying assignment is: 1=true, 2=false, 3=false, 4=true, 5=true.
