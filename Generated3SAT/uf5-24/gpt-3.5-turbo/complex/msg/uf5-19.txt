To solve this problem, we can apply the SAT solving algorithm to the given DIMACS SAT problem. We will look for a solution that satisfies all the clauses.

Starting with the first clause: 1 2 -3 0
- We can see that the variables 1 and 2 are positive, while variable 3 is negated. To satisfy this clause, we need to assign True values to variables 1 and 2, and False to variable 3.

Continuing with the rest of the clauses, we can systematically assign truth values to the variables in each clause to satisfy them.

After going through all 24 clauses, we find the following assignment that satisfies all the clauses:
1 = True
2 = True
3 = False
4 = True
5 = False

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: 1 2 -3 4 -5
