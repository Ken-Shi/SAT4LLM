Given the SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format:

p cnf 5 24
4 5 -3 0
1 -4 -3 0
2 -5 4 0
-2 -5 4 0
-5 2 1 0
-3 4 1 0
2 -5 4 0
2 -5 -1 0
-5 -3 2 0
-3 1 5 0
1 4 2 0
4 1 2 0
2 1 4 0
2 1 4 0
-3 2 -1 0
-3 1 -4 0
4 2 1 0
-5 -4 -3 0
-2 4 1 0
1 -5 2 0
2 1 -3 0
3 -2 1 0
3 5 1 0
-2 4 1 0

By converting the problem into a system of equations, we can try to solve it. 
The equations provided have the following representation:
4 5 -3
1 -4 -3
2 -5 4
-2 -5 4
-5 2 1
-3 4 1
2 -5 4
2 -5 -1
-5 -3 2
-3 1 5
1 4 2
4 1 2
2 1 4
2 1 4
-3 2 -1
-3 1 -4
4 2 1
-5 -4 -3
-2 4 1
1 -5 2
2 1 -3
3 -2 1
3 5 1
-2 4 1

Looking at the clauses, we can see that some variables are repeated in different clauses. Therefore, we need to find a combination of variables that would satisfy all the clauses. 

After going through each clause, we can see that there are multiple instances where variables are repeated, making it hard to find a valid solution. 

Therefore, it does not seem feasible to find a solution that satisfies all the clauses simultaneously. 

answer: No solution possible.
