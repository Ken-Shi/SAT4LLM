To solve this SAT problem using DIMACS format, we will first convert the problem into conjunctive normal form (CNF) format. The given problem is already in CNF format, so we can directly analyze each clause to determine the solution.

1. 2 -5 4: This means either 2 is true, or -5 is true, or 4 is true. This clause can be satisfied by setting 2 = True, -5 = False, and 4 = True.
2. 2 -3 -1: This clause can be satisfied by setting 2 = True, -3 = False, and -1 = True.
3. -4 -5 -3: This clause can be satisfied by setting -4 = True, -5 = True, and -3 = True.
4. 2 -3 -4: This clause can be satisfied by setting 2 = True, -3 = False, and -4 = False.
5. 2 -1 -3: This clause can be satisfied by setting 2 = True, -1 = False, and -3 = False.

Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:
2 = True
-5 = False
4 = True
-3 = False
-1 = False

answer: 2 -5 4 -3 -1
