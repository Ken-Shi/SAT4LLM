To solve this SAT problem, we can use a SAT solver like Z3 or MiniSat. However, since the problem is provided in DIMACS format, we can also solve it manually.

First, let's represent the problem in a more readable format:

(3 OR -5 OR 4)
(-5 OR -4 OR -3)
(-1 OR -5 OR 4)
(-3 OR 5 OR 4)
(-5 OR 2 OR -4)
(-5 OR 2 OR -1)
(-3 OR 2 OR -1)
(-5 OR 4 OR -1)
(-5 OR -3 OR -4)
(2 OR -5 OR -1)
(-5 OR -3 OR 4)
(1 OR 4 OR 2)
(-5 OR -3 OR 4)
(4 OR -2 OR 5)
(1 OR -5 OR -3)
(2 OR -3 OR -1)
(1 OR 2 OR 5)
(-1 OR 4 OR -3)
(-4 OR -3 OR -5)
(-5 OR 4 OR -1)
(2 OR -3 OR -1)
(-2 OR -1 OR -3)
(4 OR -1 OR -5)
(-1 OR 2 OR -5)

Now, let's try to manually satisfy the clauses:

From clause (4 OR -2 OR 5), we can satisfy 5.
From clause (-5 OR -4 OR -3), we can satisfy -5.
From clause (-1 OR -5 OR 4), we can satisfy -5.
From clause (-3 OR 5 OR 4), we can satisfy -3.
From clause (1 OR 2 OR 5), we can satisfy 1.
From clause (3 OR -5 OR 4), we can satisfy 3.
From clause (-5 OR -3 OR -4), we can satisfy -4.
From clause (2 OR -5 OR -1), we can satisfy 2.
From clause (-3 OR 2 OR -1), we can satisfy -1.

Therefore, the solution that satisfies all the clauses is: 5, -5, -5, -3, 1, 3, -4, 2, -1.

answer: 5, -5, -5, -3, 1, 3, -4, 2, -1
