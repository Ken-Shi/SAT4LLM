The problem is in CNF form with 5 variables and 24 clauses.\n2. We will use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment of truth values for the variables.\n\nNow, let's use a SAT solver to find the solution.\n\n**Answer:** \nThe given SAT problem is satisfiable with the following assignment:\n1. Variable 1 is true\n2. Variable 2 is false\n3. Variable 3 is false\n4. Variable 4 is true\n5. Variable 5 is true"
