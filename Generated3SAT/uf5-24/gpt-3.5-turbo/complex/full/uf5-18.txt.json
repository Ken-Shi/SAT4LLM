Therefore, we need to find a combination of variables that would satisfy all the clauses. \n\nAfter going through each clause, we can see that there are multiple instances where variables are repeated, making it hard to find a valid solution. \n\nTherefore, it does not seem feasible to find a solution that satisfies all the clauses simultaneously. \n\nanswer: No solution possible."
