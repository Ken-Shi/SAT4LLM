The problem has 5 variables and 24 clauses.\n\nLine of thoughts:\n1. Input the clauses into the SAT solver in DIMACS format.\n2. Let the SAT solver determine if there is a satisfying assignment for the given set of clauses.\n3. If the SAT solver outputs a solution, interpret the variable assignments to satisfy all the clauses.\n\nFinal answer:\nanswer: The given SAT problem is satisfiable. One possible satisfying assignment is: 1=true, 2=false, 3=false, 4=true, 5=true."
