The given problem is already in CNF format, so we can directly analyze each clause to determine the solution.\n\n1. 2 -5 4: This means either 2 is true, or -5 is true, or 4 is true. This clause can be satisfied by setting 2 = True, -5 = False, and 4 = True.\n2. 2 -3 -1: This clause can be satisfied by setting 2 = True, -3 = False, and -1 = True.\n3. -4 -5 -3: This clause can be satisfied by setting -4 = True, -5 = True, and -3 = True.\n4. 2 -3 -4: This clause can be satisfied by setting 2 = True, -3 = False, and -4 = False.\n5. 2 -1 -3: This clause can be satisfied by setting 2 = True, -1 = False, and -3 = False.\n\nTherefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:\n2 = True\n-5 = False\n4 = True\n-3 = False\n-1 = False\n\nanswer: 2 -5 4 -3 -1"
