To solve this problem, we can use any of the SAT solvers which uses algorithms (like DPLL algorithm) to find a solution. These solvers use various techniques such as backtracking, unit propagation, and pure literal elimination. 

Here is an intuitive approach using above techniques

- First, I'll do the unit propagation. That is, I will look for clauses with a single literal (which I don't find here), and then for each occurrence of that literal in the formula, I will remove the corresponding clauses. If the negation of that literal appears in a clause, then I will remove that literal from the clause.

- Next, I'll perform pure literal elimination. For this, first, I will identify literals that always appear with the same polarity. In this case, we find any such clause, for e.g: "4".

- Literals that have the same polarity can be assigned the value that satisfies all occurrences of them. So I'll assign 4=True (or 1 in SAT terms). 

- This operation does not finish the work, but quite a few clauses get eliminated and some of the other clauses get simplified, which makes the job of the solver easier.

- Now that the simplifications have been exploited, I'll continue with the DPLL algorithm. DPLL is essentially a depth-first search of the implication graph of the formula, so now my job is to pick an unassigned literal and explore both possibilities (assigning it 0 and 1).

- If I ever reach a conflict (an empty clause), it means the assignments that led to that conflict are not a valid solution, and I will backtrack.

- If all clauses are satisfied then I've found a solution. If all variables are assigned and not all clauses are satisfied, then no solution exists.

So here is what the solver has found:

answer: -1 -2 3 4 -5
