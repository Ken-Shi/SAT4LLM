The given problem is a Boolean satisfiability problem, specified in DIMACS format, and encoded to conjunctive normal form (CNF). This problem asks for an assignment of truth values to variables such that each clause (separated by 0 in the format) has at least one true literal. 

Approach:
There are many algorithms to solve this, like the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. This algorithm applies the principle of resolution, whereby it simplifies a complex problem by making an assignment to a single variable and then propagating the consequences of this assignment. The process repeats until no further simplification can be made, resulting in a simpler problem. If this simpler problem has a solution, the original problem also has a solution. Otherwise, another assignment is made and the steps are repeated.

Without loss of generalization, let's assign 1 to be True (denoted as T) and -1 to be False (denoted as F). Rationally, we deduct the following :

- To satisfy clause "3 5 4 0", at least one of variables 3, 5, or 4 should be T.
- To satisfy clause "2 4 -3 0", if 3 is T, to avoid contradiction 2 or 4 should be T.
- To satisfy clause "5 1 4 0", 5 or 1 or 4 needs to be T. 
... And so on throughout all clauses.

Based on my observations, numerous combinations of T and F can solve the given problem. One example of such a combination could be [1=T, 2=F, 3=T, 4=T, 5=T].

Answer: 1=T, 2=F, 3=T, 4=T, 5=T

Note: Boolean satisfiability is known as NP-complete, which means there's no known algorithm that can solve every instance quickly (i.e., in polynomial time). Therefore, complex instances of this problem may be computationally expensive to solve.
