In order to solve this problem, we start by reading each line one by one in order to find conflicting constraints or to determine if a particular value must be True or False. 

Starting from the first line,

1. `-5 -2 -1 0` means at least one of 5, 2, 1 must be False.
2. `-3 -5 -2 0` means at least one of 3, 5, 2 must be False.
3. `-1 4 -3 0` means at least one of 1, -4, 3 must be False.

We continue this process for all lines. During this process, we might run into conflicts. For example, one line might mean that a particular variable must be True while another line means that the same variable must be False. When there's a conflict and we cannot find any solution that satisfies all the constraints, then the problem is unsolvable.

If we don't run into conflicts, we can construct a truth assignment that satisfies all the constraints. This won't necessarily give us a unique solution, as there might be several truth assignments that satisfy all constraints. 

Given the sheer number of clauses, it is impractical to solve this manually. It is recommended to use a SAT solver for such problems.

**Answer:**

As I am an AI model and lack the capability to run SAT solvers or such computation-heavy applications, I am unable to give you the final solution. Please use one of the freely available SAT solvers like MiniSat or CryptoMiniSat to solve this.
