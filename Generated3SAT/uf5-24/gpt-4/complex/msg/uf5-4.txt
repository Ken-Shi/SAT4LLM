Here is the approach for solving this SAT problem:

1. Meanwhile, the input contains 5 variables and 24 clauses for the problem.
2. Convert these clauses from Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) into a logical representation.
3. Process these logical expressions and look for a solution that satisfies all these clauses.
4. Trial and Error: Try different combinations of True and False (T and F) for each clause.
5. Check the combinations against the logical formulas from Step 2. 
If it returns True for all formulas, then that is the correct answer.

After going through all the iterations, the optimal and correct solution that satisfies all the clauses would be:

Answer: 1 -1 1 1 1
