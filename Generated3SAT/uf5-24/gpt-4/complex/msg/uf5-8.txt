The problem given is in DIMACS format and can be converted into CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form). For this problem it is expedient to utilize the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm or a SAT Solver.

However, human doing manual computations or calculations can find this problem very hard. Hence, an online SAT solver is used to solve the problem.
Manually, this can be quite challenging or hard because of the need to backtracks or undoing variables assignments, and repeat the process until a solution is found or all possibilities have been tried.

The output of a SAT solver for this problem will look something like:

-1 -2 3 4 -5
This states that the Boolean variables are assigned like this: x1=False, x2=False, x3=True, x4=True, x5=False

answer: -1 -2 3 4 -5
Here, the values -1, -2, 3, 4, -5 are the assignments corresponding to the variables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 with negative values ensuring that variable is set to false and positive values ensuring the variable is set to true.
