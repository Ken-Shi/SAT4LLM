To interpret the problem and solve it can be understood as a SAT problem, which is an algorithmic problem of determining if there exists an interpretation which satisfies a given Boolean formula. The formula is presented in DIMACS format, which is essentially a list of clauses separated by zeroes.

The SAT problem is solved using a SAT solver, and the SAT solver will output whether the expression is satisfiable or not. 

If the expression is satisfiable, the solver will provide a set of values for each of the variables (denoted by integers 1 through 5) in the problem that makes the expression true. 

If the expression is unsatisfiable, it means there's no set of variable assignments that will make the entire thing true. 

To solve the problem one would use a software or computational solver to conscribe these inputs. 

Let's take an interpreter and solver software for this SAT problem:

INPUT:
p cnf 5 24
-4 -1 5 0
-1 -3 -4 0
-2 -4 5 0
-5 -4 -2 0
-4 -5 -2 0
-2 3 5 0
3 1 -4 0
-3 -4 1 0
-2 -1 5 0
-1 -2 3 0
3 -4 -1 0
1 3 5 0
5 -2 1 0
-1 -2 -4 0
3 -2 5 0
5 -1 3 0
5 -4 3 0
3 2 4 0
-1 -2 3 0
3 2 5 0
5 -4 -2 0
-2 -1 -3 0
5 3 -2 0
-2 3 -5 0

OUTPUT:
SAT
1 -2 3 -4 5

Answer: 1 -2 3 -4 5
