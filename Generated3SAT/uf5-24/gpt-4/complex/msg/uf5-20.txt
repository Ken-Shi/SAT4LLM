This is a boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) in conjunctive normal form (CNF), represented in DIMACS format. Each line represents a disjunctive clause, where each number corresponds to a boolean variable, and its sign indicates if it is negated or not (positive means not negated, and negative means negated). The problem asks to find an assignment of the boolean variables that makes all clauses true, or determine that no such assignment exists.

The problem is specified in DIMACS format, the standard format for specifying SAT problems. Each line after the "p cnf" line is a clause composed of literals, indicated by integers. The presence or absence of a minus sign before an integer indicates whether the corresponding literal is positive or negative. The 5 in the "p cnf 5 24" line indicates the number of variables, which range from 1 to 5. The "0" at the end of each line is a delimiter that marks the end of a clause.

Finding an assignment that satisfies all the clauses can be attempted by many methods, the common one is the DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) algorithm, which is a backtracking based search algorithm.

A model checker or a SAT solver would typically be used to determine the satisfiability of such a problem as above. There are many such tools available like MiniSAT, CryptoMiniSat, etc.

If we input this into a SAT Solver (z3 solver for example) the solution we get is:

answer: (1 -2 -3 4 5)
