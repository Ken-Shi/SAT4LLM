Let's solve the problem step-by-step:\n\nStep 1: Given the first clause, \"1 -3 2 0\", we can see that if we set variable 1 to true (1), and variable 2 to true (1) variable 3 can be false (-3 or 0). \n\nStep 2: Similarly from the second clause, \"4 3 2 0\", if we set variable 4 to true (1), and as we already have variable 2 as true (from step 1), we can set variable 3 to true (1) as well.\n\nStep 3: For the clause, \"-3 2 5 0\". We have variable 2 as true from the previous steps and if we set variable 5 to true, then variable 3 can be false.\n\nStep 4: Clauses \"3 -5 4 0\" and \"2 3 -1 0\" also align with the Boolean values obtained till now. There isn't any clause that contradicts our current values. \n\nStep 5: The remaining clauses also align with the current values and none of them contradicts our values. \n\nTherefore, our solution is {1=T, 2=T, 3=F, 4=T, 5=T}\n\nAnswer: {1=T, 2=T, 3=F, 4=T, 5=T}"
