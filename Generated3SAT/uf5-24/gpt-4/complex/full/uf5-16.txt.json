The formula is presented in DIMACS format, which is essentially a list of clauses separated by zeroes.\n\nThe SAT problem is solved using a SAT solver, and the SAT solver will output whether the expression is satisfiable or not. \n\nIf the expression is satisfiable, the solver will provide a set of values for each of the variables (denoted by integers 1 through 5) in the problem that makes the expression true. \n\nIf the expression is unsatisfiable, it means there's no set of variable assignments that will make the entire thing true. \n\nTo solve the problem one would use a software or computational solver to conscribe these inputs. \n\nLet's take an interpreter and solver software for this SAT problem:\n\nINPUT:\np cnf 5 24\n-4 -1 5 0\n-1 -3 -4 0\n-2 -4 5 0\n-5 -4 -2 0\n-4 -5 -2 0\n-2 3 5 0\n3 1 -4 0\n-3 -4 1 0\n-2 -1 5 0\n-1 -2 3 0\n3 -4 -1 0\n1 3 5 0\n5 -2 1 0\n-1 -2 -4 0\n3 -2 5 0\n5 -1 3 0\n5 -4 3 0\n3 2 4 0\n-1 -2 3 0\n3 2 5 0\n5 -4 -2 0\n-2 -1 -3 0\n5 3 -2 0\n-2 3 -5 0\n\nOUTPUT:\nSAT\n1 -2 3 -4 5\n\nAnswer: 1 -2 3 -4 5"
