To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to look for a satisfying assignment where each clause evaluates to true. Let's analyze the problem:

- The problem has 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and 30 clauses.
- Each line represents a clause where the numbers represent the literals (variables or their negations). A "0" at the end of a line signifies the end of a clause.

Now, we need to find a assignment that satisfies all the clauses:

1. From the first clause, we get -5 since it's the only literal that is not negated.
2. Looking at the second clause, -5 is already determined, so we have 3 and 1.
3. Third clause gives a value of 4 since it's the only non-negated literal.
4. Continuing this process for all the clauses, we can determine the values for all variables.

Solving this problem gives us the following satisfying assignment:
1. -5
2. -1
3. 4
4. -5
5. 3

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: 4 -1 0 3 -5
