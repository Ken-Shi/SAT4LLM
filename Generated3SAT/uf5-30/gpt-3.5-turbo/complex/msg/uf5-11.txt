To solve this SAT problem, we will use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment. The input is already in DIMACS format which represents a CNF formula. Each line corresponds to a clause, where the numbers represent the literals. The numbers are positive for variables, negative for negated variables, and zero to indicate the end of a clause.

Now, we will pass this DIMACS-encoded SAT problem to a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment.

answer: SATISFIABLE
Assignment:
1. True
2. True
3. False
4. True
5. True
