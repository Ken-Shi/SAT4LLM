To solve this SAT problem, we need to represent the given problem in conjunctive normal form (CNF). The provided input is already given in DIMACS format, which is commonly used to represent SAT problems.

We have 5 variables and 30 clauses in the CNF. The goal is to find an assignment of truth values to the variables (true or false) that satisfies all the clauses.

Here is the logical representation of the problem:
?x4 ? x1 ? ?x3
x2 ? x1 ? ?x3
x2 ? ?x3 ? ?x5
?x5 ? x2 ? ?x1
?x5 ? x2 ? ?x3
x2 ? x4 ? x1
x1 ? ?x3 ? ?x4
?x5 ? ?x3 ? ?x4
x3 ? ?x2 ? ?x5
x1 ? ?x2 ? x5
?x3 ? ?x5 ? x1
?x4 ? x1 ? x3
x2 ? x4 ? ?x5
x5 ? ?x4 ? x2
x3 ? x2 ? ?x4
x5 ? ?x3 ? ?x1
?x3 ? ?x5 ? x2
?x3 ? ?x5 ? x4
?x5 ? x2 ? ?x3
x5 ? x1 ? ?x4
x2 ? ?x5 ? x1
?x4 ? ?x5 ? ?x3
?x3 ? x2 ? ?x4
x3 ? ?x4 ? x1
?x4 ? ?x5 ? x2
?x4 ? x1 ? ?x3
?x5 ? ?x3 ? x4
x1 ? ?x4 ? x2
x1 ? x2 ? ?x4
?x5 ? x2 ? x1

We can use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment for the given CNF. After solving the problem, the final answer will include the assignment of truth values for each variable that satisfies all the clauses.

answer: x1=true, x2=false, x3=false, x4=false, x5=true
