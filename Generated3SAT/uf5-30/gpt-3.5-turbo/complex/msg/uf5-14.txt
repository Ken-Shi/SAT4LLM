To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will apply the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. We will start by initializing an empty assignment and an empty list of clauses. Then, we will iterate through each line of the DIMACS format and add the clauses to our list of clauses. We will continue this process until all clauses are added.

Next, we will start the DPLL algorithm by looking for unit clauses (clauses with a single literal). If we find a unit clause, we will assign the appropriate value to make that clause true.

After assigning values based on unit clauses, we will check for pure literals (literals that only appear as positive or negative). We will assign values to these pure literals to satisfy the clauses they appear in.

Then, we will enter the main DPLL loop, where we will choose a literal, assign a value (true or false), and proceed with the algorithm. If we come across any conflicts, we will backtrack and try a different assignment.

The final answer will be the assignment of true or false values to each variable in the form of a solution.

answer: 1 -1 -1 -1 -1
