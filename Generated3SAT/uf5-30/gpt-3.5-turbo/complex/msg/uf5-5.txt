To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use a SAT solver. However, we can also simplify the problem by looking at some patterns in the clauses.

Looking at the clauses, we can see that there are many clauses that involve the variables -4 and 1. In particular, the clauses:
- 1 -2 -4 0
-4 -2 5 0
-4 -5 1 0
-4 -5 1 0
-4 3 5 0
-4 -5 -2 0
-4 -5 1 0
-4 3 5 0
-4 1 5 0
-4 -2 -5 0
-4 1 5 0
-5 1 4 0
-5 -4 3 0
-5 -4 3 0
-4 -2 1 0
-4 3 1 0
-4 -2 -5 0
-4 -2 1 0
-3 1 -4 0
-4 -2 1 0
-4 -5 5 0
-5 -4 4 0
-5 -4 3 0
-3 -4 1 0
-4 -5 1 0
-4 -1 -2 0
-4 -2 5 0

We see that the variables -4 and 1 appear together in many clauses. Looking through these clauses, we can see that there is no consistent assignment that satisfies all these clauses together. For example, if -4 is False, then 1 must be True to satisfy some clauses, but others require 1 to be False.

Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is that it is unsatisfiable.

answer: unsatisfiable
