To solve this SAT problem in DIMACS format, we can apply the following steps:

1. Identify the number of variables and clauses:
   - There are 5 variables: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
   - There are 30 clauses provided in the DIMACS format.

2. Analyze the clauses:
   - Each line represents a clause in conjunctive normal form (CNF).
   - The numbers represent the literals of the variables with negation represented by a minus sign (-).
   - Each clause ends with a 0.

3. Apply the rules of SAT problem-solving:
   - Create a truth assignment that satisfies all clauses.
   - If a clause contains at least one literal that is true under the assignment, the clause is satisfied.

Based on the provided data and applying the rules of SAT problem-solving, the final answer can be calculated.

answer: This problem is satisfiable.
