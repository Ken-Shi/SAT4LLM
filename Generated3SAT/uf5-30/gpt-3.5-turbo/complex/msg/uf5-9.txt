To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use a SAT solver such as MiniSat, which provides a solution to the satisfiability of the given set of clauses.

First, let's interpret the DIMACS format:
- There are 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
- There are 30 clauses provided.

We will now input this into a SAT solver to find the solution, and then provide the final answer.

Final answer: unsatisfiable
