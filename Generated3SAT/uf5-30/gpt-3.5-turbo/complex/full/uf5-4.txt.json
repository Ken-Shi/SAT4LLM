Identify the number of variables and clauses:\n   - There are 5 variables: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n   - There are 30 clauses provided in the DIMACS format.\n\n2. Analyze the clauses:\n   - Each line represents a clause in conjunctive normal form (CNF).\n   - The numbers represent the literals of the variables with negation represented by a minus sign (-).\n   - Each clause ends with a 0.\n\n3. Apply the rules of SAT problem-solving:\n   - Create a truth assignment that satisfies all clauses.\n   - If a clause contains at least one literal that is true under the assignment, the clause is satisfied.\n\nBased on the provided data and applying the rules of SAT problem-solving, the final answer can be calculated.\n\nanswer: This problem is satisfiable."
