However, we can also simplify the problem by looking at some patterns in the clauses.\n\nLooking at the clauses, we can see that there are many clauses that involve the variables -4 and 1. In particular, the clauses:\n- 1 -2 -4 0\n-4 -2 5 0\n-4 -5 1 0\n-4 -5 1 0\n-4 3 5 0\n-4 -5 -2 0\n-4 -5 1 0\n-4 3 5 0\n-4 1 5 0\n-4 -2 -5 0\n-4 1 5 0\n-5 1 4 0\n-5 -4 3 0\n-5 -4 3 0\n-4 -2 1 0\n-4 3 1 0\n-4 -2 -5 0\n-4 -2 1 0\n-3 1 -4 0\n-4 -2 1 0\n-4 -5 5 0\n-5 -4 4 0\n-5 -4 3 0\n-3 -4 1 0\n-4 -5 1 0\n-4 -1 -2 0\n-4 -2 5 0\n\nWe see that the variables -4 and 1 appear together in many clauses. Looking through these clauses, we can see that there is no consistent assignment that satisfies all these clauses together. For example, if -4 is False, then 1 must be True to satisfy some clauses, but others require 1 to be False.\n\nTherefore, the solution to this SAT problem is that it is unsatisfiable.\n\nanswer: unsatisfiable"
