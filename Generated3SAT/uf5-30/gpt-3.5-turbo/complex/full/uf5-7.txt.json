(2 4 -1)\n2. (-4 -5 2)\n3. (-4 2 -1)\n4. (-1 2 -4)\n5. (2 -1 3)\n6. (-3 -5 -4)\n7. (-5 3 -1)\n8. (3 -5 1)\n9. (-5 3 -1)\n10. (5 3 -1)\n11. (-5 3 1)\n12. (2 -4 -1)\n13. (2 -4 3)\n14. (-1 -5 3)\n15. (3 -4 -1)\n16. (-4 -1 -2)\n17. (-1 -3 -5)\n18. (3 -5 -1)\n19. (2 -4 3)\n20. (-1 3 -5)\n21. (2 -1 -4)\n22. (3 -5 1)\n23. (-5 3 -4)\n24. (-1 -4 3)\n25. (5 3 -4)\n26. (-3 -4 -5)\n27. (2 3 -4)\n28. (-4 2 3)\n29. (-5 2 1)\n30. (-5 -4 3)\n\nLet's try to find a consistent assignment for the variables that satisfies all clauses.\nStarting with the first clause, we see that variable 2 must be true. Then, the second clause implies that variables 4 and 5 must be false. Continuing this process, we can determine the following assignments:\n- 2 is true\n- 4 and 5 are false\n- 1 is true\n- 3 is true\n\nWhen we try to satisfy the remaining clauses with these assignments, we can see that the clauses are mutually contradictory, which means that there is no possible consistent assignment that satisfies all the clauses. Therefore, the problem is unsatisfiable.\n\nanswer: unsatisfiable"
