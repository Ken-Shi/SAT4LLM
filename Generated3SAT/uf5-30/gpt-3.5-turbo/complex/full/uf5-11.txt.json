Each line corresponds to a clause, where the numbers represent the literals. The numbers are positive for variables, negative for negated variables, and zero to indicate the end of a clause.\n\nNow, we will pass this DIMACS-encoded SAT problem to a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment.\n\nanswer: SATISFIABLE\nAssignment:\n1.
