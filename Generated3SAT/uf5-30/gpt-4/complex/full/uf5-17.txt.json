                "content": "The given SAT problem is in Conjunctive Normal Form where each clause is a disjunction of variables and the formula itself is a conjunction of these clauses.\n\nThe general approach to solving this is to use a SAT solver. However, since the question asks for a general line of thoughts, here it is:\nWe start by picking a variable, assigning a truth value to it (true/false), simplifying the formula and repeating the process:\n\n1. Let's say we pick variable 1 and assign it as False (-1). Any clause that contains -1 in it will be True, so we can remove those clauses from the formula. The remaining clauses that contain 1 are now False, meaning 1 can be removed from those clauses. \n\n2. Repeat the process with another variable, let's say variable 2 is True (2). Eliminate clauses that contain 2, and remove -2 from the remaining clauses.\n\n3. Continue until all variables are assigned.\n\nRemember that this might lead to an unsatisfiable situation in some cases, which means the initially assigned truth values were wrong.\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that the above method uses backtracking and may not result in the most efficient solution time-wise. There are more efficient algorithms to solve a SAT problem such as DPLL, WalkSat, and CDCL.\n\nWith real SAT solvers, we would feed the problem and get a solution (if one exists).\n\nHowever, as a human, it is practically impossible to solve this without a program since it contains a lot of variables and clauses, requiring intensive computation.\n\nAnswer: Could not be solved manually. Please use a SAT solver."
