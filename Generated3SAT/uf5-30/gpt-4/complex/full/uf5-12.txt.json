                "content": "This problem is solved by using the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm, which is the most common algorithm used for satisfiability problems also known as SAT problem. It works as follows:\n\n1) It picks a literal that exists within the clauses.\n2) It modifies all clauses containing that literal.\n3) If a clause becomes empty, the literal chosen initially is incorrect. It then changes the truth value of the literal and proceeds.\n4) If all clauses are satisfied, it found a solution and stops.\n\nThe line of thought taken to solve the given problem is:\n\n1) Select a literal, for instance -1.\n2) We have 8 clauses containing the literal -1, we resolve them.\n3) If all clauses are satisfied, we are done.\n4) If not, we utilize another literal and repeat the process.\n\nFollowing this process for the given formulas:\n\nWe start off making -1 true, which is simplest because -1 appears in either form in a number of clauses. After we set -1, a number of clauses evaluate to true and are thus discarded.\n\nNow, several clauses only contain one variable, and these variables must be set such that the clause is satisfied. Simultaneously, clauses will simplify as covered variables are discarded.\n\nWe set 5 to false, which means we can also set 2 to true, given which 3 becomes true.\n\nLastly, the only option for 4 is to be false.\n\nAfter following the process sequentially, we have evaluated all 5 variables. \n\nanswer: The solution therefore is -1, -4, 2, 3, -5\n"
