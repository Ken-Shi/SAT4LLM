This is a SAT (Satisfiability) problem. This problem involves determining the satisfiability of a given boolean formula given in conjunctive normal form (CNF). 

The DIMACS format is a standard for specifying SAT problems. Every line with the zeroes is a clause and it ends when it encounters zero. The variables indicated with a number from 1 to 5 and a negative sign indicates the negative literals of the variable.

You can solve it manually for a small problem like this, but in practice, we'd use SAT solvers, like MiniSAT, zChaff, etc.

To solve this problem manually, I will use the DPLL algorithm (Davis, Putnam, Logemann, Loveland), which is a backtracking-based search algorithm and a unit propagation. The basic idea is to pick a literal, assign a truth value to it and simplify the formula. If we reach a contradiction, we backtrack and flip the value of the recent variable.

Higher absolute values represent earlier decisions. I'll use the convention that assigning false to a literal is an earlier decision than assigning true.

My approach:
1. Start with the first clause '-3 5 -1 0'. Assigning true to 3 (the negative is removed to indicate that it was assigned false) satisfies the clause. Simplify the clauses where 3 appears, mostly it will eliminate those clauses. This keeps eliminating and simplifying the clauses.
2. Update the formula again, with '-4 5 -3 0', '-4 -3 5 0', ' -2 -3 5 0', ' -2 -3 -5 0'. 
3. Steps are repeated until either all clauses are eliminated (indicating a solution has been found), or a contradiction is encountered (which is to say, an empty clause is derived), which shows that the problem is unsatisfiable. 

After repeating steps above, one possible solution is as follows:

Answer: 
1 -1 -2 -3 4 5
