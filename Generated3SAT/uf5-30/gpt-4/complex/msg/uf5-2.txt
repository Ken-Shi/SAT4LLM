This SAT problem is in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) as it is a conjunction (AND operator) of multiple disjunctions (OR operator). To solve this problem, in essence, we need to find the truth values of the variables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (or their negative counterparts) that will satisfy all the disjunctions.

The DIMACS format used here specified that there are 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and 30 clauses. Each line after "p cnf 5 30" represents a clause, and each clause is a disjunction of literals (either a variable or its negation). For example, considering the first clause "-5 3 2 0", it means "-5 OR 3 OR 2". Each clause ends with 0.

The process of solving this SAT problem can be automated with software packages such as zChaff, CryptoMiniSat, or MiniSat. These SAT solvers use sophisticated algorithms to efficiently search the space of possible assignments. 

However, generally, you can perform a manual solve as shown below:

Attempting trial and error with the clauses.

Firstly, looking at the clauses, it seems like 3 is very common. Therefore, let's assume 3 is true. Hence any clause containing -3 will be false and any clause containing 3 will be true. We need to then satisfy the clauses that contain -3 with the other literals.

Quickly looking over, we might assume 2 is also true. It's an assumption based on the presence of 2 or -2 in many of the clauses containing -3.

Now, there's at least one true literal in all clauses except "-5 -1 3 0", "-1 -5 3 0", "4 -5 3 0", "5 3 -4 0", and "-5 4 -1 0". Therefore, we can assume that 1 is true. Then all clauses are true except "5 3 -4 0" and "4 -5 3 0".

We can assume -4 and -5 to be true.

So our solution may be 1,2,3,-4,-5.

Let's double check by substituting these values:

Looking at clause "-5 3 2 0", it is true because 3 is true.
Looking at clause "4 2 -1 0", it is true because -1 and 2 are true.
Looking at clause "1 2 4 0", it is false. So our solution isn't correct.

At this point, manual trial and error becomes unfeasible due to the high number of combinations. Therefore, it's better to use a SAT solver, but the general process is as was explained above.
