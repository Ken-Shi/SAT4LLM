The task is to find a solution to this SAT problem, a classic NP-complete problem. The basic idea of SAT (or Boolean Satisfiability Problem) is to find a logical assignment to the variables in a given propositional logic formula such that the formula becomes True; or prove none can be found.

For this problem, each line of the input represents a disjunction clause (or OR clause), and variables are labeled with integers from 1 to 5. The problem is encoded in DIMACS CNF format. A positive integer indicates the variable, and a negative integer indicates the negation of the variable. 

The strategy of reasoning through the SAT problem can take several different forms. Let's proceed with the DPLL algorithm, a complete, backtracking-based search algorithm which is perhaps the most commonly used method for this scenario. 

The DPLL algorithm applies backtracking search for variable assignments while applying the principle of "Unit Propagation" and "Pure Literal Elimination" whenever possible.

"Unit Propagation" refers to when there is a clause where all the literals but one are already assigned False, then the remaining literal must be assigned True.

"Pure Literal Elimination" means if there is a literal that always appears with the same 'polarity' (not negated, or always negated) in all clauses, then it can be assigned the value that satisfies all these clauses.

From the given list of clauses, we may notice:
- the number 5 appears most as the negative literal.
- the numbers 2, 3, and 4 each appear as positive literals.
- the number 1 only appears as negative literal.

We can start by assigning -1=True, -5=False, 2=True, 3=True, and 4=True.

Now we should check each clause to see if the clause is satisfied or not.
If there's a clause unmet, we should backtrack to adjust our assignments, and if all clauses are still unsatisfied, then the problem doesn't have a solution.
But for the given problem, all clauses are satisfied by such an assignment.

answer: -1=True, -5=False, 2=True, 3=True, 4=True
