To solve this SAT Problem in DIMACS format using the DPLL algorithm, you can do the following:

Firstly, the DPLL algorithm is an algorithm of unit propagation, pure literal elimination, and backtracking. The 'unit propagation' rule finds a clause with a single unassigned literal - the other unit clause - and enforces the rule that the value assigned to this variable must satisfy this clause. The 'pure literal elimination' rule, on the other hand, assigns to variables in such a way as to satisfy all clauses that contain unassigned pure literals.

1. From the provided SAT problem, look for unit clauses. For each, assign the value that satisfies the clause.

2. Look for pure literals, literals that always occur with the same polarity. Assign to each pure literal the value that satisfies all clauses where it appears.

3. Now check if the clauses are all satisfied with the current assignment. If yes, then you have a solution. If not, choose a variable that has not been assigned and assign True and False to it, then recursively try and find a satisfying assignment in each case.

4. If none of the above steps worked, backtrack to the next most recent assignment that has not been explored - This is the last assigned variable with an unexplored value.

If we follow these steps, we get the following:

1. There are no unit clauses.
2. All literals are pure literals, since no literal occurs with both true and false polarity. Assign true to every literal.
3. All clauses are satisfied by this assignment.
4. There is no need for backtracking.

So this problem is trivially solvable, because there is no literal that occurs with both true and false polarity: each literal always occurs in the same polarity.

Answer: For an assignment, all the variables (1,2,3,4,5) can be set to True.
