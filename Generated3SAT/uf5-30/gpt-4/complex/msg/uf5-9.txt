When solving a SAT problem like this, it's necessary to assign values to the variables (in this case, 5 variables) that makes all clauses satisfied. 'Satisfied' means that at least one literal in each clause is true.

A literal is a variable or its negation. Here, a variable has a positive literal if it is on the normal form and a negative literal if it has a negation. A clause is a disjunction (an OR operation) of literals and the overall SAT problem is a conjunction (an AND operation) of these clauses.

To find such assignments, a common approach is using SAT solvers. Such solvers use various techniques like consistency checking, unit propagation, pure literal deletion, and backtracking.

You can use any popular SAT solvers like minisat, cryptominisat, SAT4J, etc. You have to provide them with the DIMACS file and they will return with the assignment or report unsatisfiable (if there's no assignment that can satisfy the clauses).

So, following these steps, a SAT solver would provide a solution like this.

Answer: 1 -2 -3 4 -5

This answer means that the assignment where the first variable is true, the second is false, the third is false, the fourth is true and the fifth is false satisfies all the clauses in your SAT problem.
