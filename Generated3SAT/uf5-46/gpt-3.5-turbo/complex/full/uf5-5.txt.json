We first go through all 46 clauses to see if any of them can be satisfied.\n\n2. We will start by looking at clause 1: 5 4 3 0. These clauses allow the variable 5 to be true, which would also satisfy clauses 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 21, 28, 31. The variables 3, 4, and 5 need to be true.\n\n3. We then follow this process through the other clauses, looking for consistent truths.\n\n4. Using this method, we can find that the solution to this SAT problem is: \nanswer: 5 -4 3 -1 2"
