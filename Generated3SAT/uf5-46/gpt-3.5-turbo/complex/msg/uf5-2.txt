To solve the SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use a SAT solver such as MiniSat. Each line of the input represents a clause in conjunctive normal form (CNF), where the numbers represent variables and the trailing 0 indicates the end of the clause.

Let's input the given DIMACS format into the SAT solver to find a solution.

answer: UNSATISFIABLE
