To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. We will start by looking for unit clauses and then iteratively assign values to variables based on those unit clauses until we either have a satisfying assignment or a conflict.

Given CNF:

p cnf 5 46
-5 -1 -2 0
-4 -5 -2 0
-4 -2 -5 0
2 3 -4 0
-5 -1 3 0
1 -4 3 0
-1 2 -4 0
1 -5 2 0
-1 2 -4 0
-2 -4 3 0
3 -5 -1 0
5 -2 -4 0
-4 -5 -1 0
-4 -1 3 0
-4 -5 3 0
-4 -1 3 0
-3 -4 -5 0
4 3 -5 0
-2 -1 -5 0
-4 2 -5 0
-1 -4 -5 0
3 2 -4 0
-5 2 3 0
-1 2 3 0
-4 3 -1 0
-4 3 -1 0
-5 3 -1 0
3 -2 -4 0
-4 3 -1 0
-2 1 -4 0
3 -5 -1 0
-1 3 -4 0
-2 3 5 0
-5 -2 -1 0
5 -4 -2 0
1 -4 -5 0
3 -1 -5 0
-2 -1 3 0
3 -2 -5 0
3 -2 -1 0
2 3 -4 0
4 3 -1 0
-1 -4 2 0
3 -1 2 0
-4 -1 3 0
-1 3 -4 0

We start with no unit clause. Let's make some assignments:
1. Assigning 5 to be False: -5
2. Unit clause: -1 from (1 -4 -5 0), assign 1 to be False: -1

After these assignments:
-5 = False
-1 = False

Check all clauses but do not yet get a unit clause. Next, make an assignment:
3. Assigning 2 to be True: 2

After this assignment:
2 = True

Check all clauses again. We have a unit clause:
4. Unit clause: -4 from (-2 -4 3 0), assign 4 to be False: -4

After this assignment:
4 = False

Check all clauses again. We have no unit clause and no more assignments to make.

Therefore, the final satisfying assignment is:
1. -5 = False
2. -1 = False
3. 2 = True
4. 4 = False
5. Undetermined

answer: -5 -1 2 -4
