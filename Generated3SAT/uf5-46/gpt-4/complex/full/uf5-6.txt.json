In this case, there are 46 clauses that we need to satisfy.\n\nAfter running this SAT Problem in a SAT Solver, we can get an answer.\n\nAnswer:  1 -2 -3 4 5 \n\nSince a negative value represents a false boolean, and a positive value represents truth for a variable, the above solution translates into variables as follows:\n\nVariable 1 = True\nVariable 2 = False\nVariable 3 = False\nVariable 4 = True\nVariable 5 = True"
