This algorithm uses backtracking, unit propagation, and pure literal elimination techniques.\n\nA surveying of the clauses can reveal a unit clause and also a pure literal which can simplify our starting point:\n\n\"We find that 4 appears in all clauses either positively or it doesn't appear at all, so we assign it a boolean true. \n\nNext, we eliminate 4 and all clauses that contain 4 from our problem, also we remove '-4' if appears in any clause. Then we find that '-3' appears in all clauses either negatively or it doesn't appear at all, so we assign it a boolean false.\n\nNext, we eliminate '-3' and all clauses that contain '-3' from our problem, also we remove '3' if appears in any clause. \n\nContinuing this process, we arrive at no contradiction and all variables have been assigned a value.\n\nAnswer: 1=True, 2=False, 3=False, 4=True, 5=False."
