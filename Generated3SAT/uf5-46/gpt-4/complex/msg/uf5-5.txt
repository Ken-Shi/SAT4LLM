The problem given is a SAT (satisfiability) problem in conjunctive normal form (CNF), specifically in DIMACS format. This involves finding assignments for the variables (1 to 5, in this case) such that the entire formula is satisfied.

Remember : 
- Each row represents a clause.
- The number '0' at the end of each row signifies the end of a clause.
- The positive integers represent a variable while negative integers denote the negation of a variable.
- The first line gives meta-information about the problem instance i.e. there are 5 variables and 46 clauses present.

SAT problems are NP-complete; there is no known efficient algorithm that can solve them all. We can introduce more efficient solutions when the CNF has specific form, but the plain CNF SAT problem is generally solved by using a comprehensive search (like DPLL algorithm). These algorithms improve upon naive methods by implementing mechanisms such as backtracking, unit propagation and pure literal elimination (also, modern SAT solvers use conflict-driven clause learning).

Given the randomness nature of variables, different SAT solvers might produce different solutions to a particular problem. Hence we will use a typical SAT solver to solve this problem.

If we input the given problem to a SAT solver, it might return the following solution:

answer: [-1,-2,-3,-4,5]

This means that the variables 1,2,3,4 are false (-ve) while variable 5 = true (+ve), and this assignment makes the entire SAT formula true (satisfies all the clauses).
