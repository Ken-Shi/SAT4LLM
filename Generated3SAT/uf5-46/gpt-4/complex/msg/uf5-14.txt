This is a boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), one of the famous NP-Complete problems. The main task here is to evaluate and assign truth values to boolean variables.

The DIMACS format states that 'p cnf 5 46' implies, it's a problem in conjunctive normal form (CNF) with 5 variables and 46 clauses. In the following lines, each line before '0' is a disjunction of literals (a clause). Let's denote the variables as a, b, c, d, e for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively. Here positive values represent the literal, negative value respresent it's negation (It's a simple 1-to-1 mapping).

The problem can be solved using different algorithms, which may include stochastic local search(SLS), the Davis?Putnam?Logemann?Loveland (DPLL) algorithm, or modern variants based on conflict-driven clause learning.

But for simplicity and without loss of generality, let's take a simple approach and let's evaluate it manually through applicable reductions and substitutions:

From clause 2: Since we have -4, it means d should be 'False'. (Note that 4 is false means -4 is true.)

From clause 4: Since -1 is in the clause, it means a should be 'False'. 

From clause 3: With a=False and -2 in the clause, b should be 'False'. 

From clause 1,3,5, etc.: With 5 in the clause, e should be 'True'. 

Now, from clause 1 and 2, to satisfiy, c should be 'True'.

Substitute these values in all the clauses to check the validity. All are satisfied. Thus we have a valid solution.

Answer: a=False, b=False, c=True, d=False, e=True.
