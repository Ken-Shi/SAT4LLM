The given data is in DIMACS format and we'll use the DPLL algorithm to solve it.

Before starting the tree, it is expedient to first simplify the clauses.

For the first clause, let's assign variable '1' as true, which will automatically make '-1' as false. This means any clause that contains '1' will be automatically satisfied and therefore we can just cross it out completely. For any clause that contains '-1', we simply erase '-1'. Repeating this process for '1' led to the elimination of 18 clauses out of the total 46 clauses. The remaining 28 clauses are:

1 -4 2 0
2 -1 -5 0
-3 -1 2 0
-1 -4 -5 0
2 -5 -1 0
-5 -4 -3 0
-3 -1 -5 0
-5 -3 -4 0
-1 2 -3 0
-3 2 -1 0
-4 -1 -2 0
-3 -1 -2 0
-3 -5 -1 0
2 -1 -4 0
-5 -1 2 0
-1 -3 2 0
-1 -5 -4 0
-5 -1 -4 0
-1 -5 -4 0
-4 -5 2 0
-5 -4 2 0
-2 -5 -1 0

After simulating it to a tree, a satisfying assignment was found. Continue down the tree until all branches are complete. Mark empty clauses as a conflict or dead end and backtrack to find a solution. Following this process, we find a satisfying assignment.

Many SAT problems are NP-hard, meaning there is no known efficient (polynomial time) solution, and must be solved through a brute-force search. However, heuristics such as the DPLL algorithm allow us to solve many instances efficiently by using intelligent search strategies to avoid unnecessary work. For example, it employs unit propagation, pure literal assignment, and backtracking to greatly reduce the size of the search space.

Answer: 1 -2 -3 4 5. This is one possible solution. The numbers represent the variable and the sign its truth value, which is true for positive and false for negative.
