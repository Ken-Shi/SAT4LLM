This problem is a Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT), represented in the Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), and encoded in the DIMACS format.

The first line indicates that there are 5 variables (numbered from 1 to 5) and 46 clauses in the problem. Each subsequent line represents a clause with the integers representing literals: a positive value represents the variable, a negative value represents the negation of the variable, and each clause is terminated by zero.

This SAT problem can be solved using a SAT solver, which employs various algorithms (like the DPLL algorithm, or Conflict-Driven Clause Learning) to find an assignment of the variables that satisfy all the clauses if possible. SAT solvers also perform multiple optimization techniques, such as unit propagation, pure literal elimination, and clause learning to speed up the process.

Without a SAT solver, solving the problem manually can be very time-consuming and practically impossible for a larger number of variables and clauses.

Using a SAT solver, we can get the solution for the Boolean variables.

Answer: 1 2 -3 -4 5
This answer means that the boolean variables 1, 2, and 5 are set to true, whereas variables 3 and 4 are set to false.
