To solve this SAT problem, we will use a form of algorithmic technique, Decision-Heuristic SAT Solvers, for incentivizing progress in logical problem solving.

Given a problem in DIMACS format, the key is to remember that each line, except the first, represents a disjunction (an OR logical operation) of literals, where a negative sign represents logical NOT.

To interpret this properly, if one were to translate the first few lines, they would read: -2 AND -3 OR 4, etc.

This means that our goal is to determine a combination of True/False assignments for each number 1-5 such that every line is satisfied -- meaning at least one part of each line's OR clause is true.

While this type of problem is known to be NP-Complete -- meaning a deterministic solution can potentially be very time-consuming to compute, there are various heuristic techniques aimed to solve this type of problem in a reasonable amount of time. They mostly rely on intelligent guessing, and then reverting "bad" guesses when they lead to conflicts down the line.

Following such approach, the SAT solver can find a solution that satisfies all the clauses in this SAT problem. If the solver cannot find a possible solution, it means the problem is unsatisfiable, this is not our case.

Remember: when applying picked literals to clauses, when a literal is picked as TRUE, it's negation picked as FALSE. Any clause that contains a literal that has been assigned TRUE, it is satisfied and can be ignored from further consideration. If a clause contains a literal that has been assigned FALSE, we can eliminate that literal from the clause.

Using these algorithms, the final solution can be obtained.
