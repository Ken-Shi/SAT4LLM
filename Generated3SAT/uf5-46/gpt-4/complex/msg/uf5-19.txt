This problem involves interpreting a given case in the DIMACS format, which is a standard format used for specifying SATisfiability problems. The given problem is defined over five variables which are referred to as 1 to 5. As such, a negative sign represents the negation of a variable.

The provided clauses suggest that the solver needs to find an assignment to the variables such that every clause has at least one literal that is true. This can be achieved by using a SAT (boolean satisfiability problem) solver, which is a software tool that can understand the DIMACS format and find a solution if one exists.

The approach involves using a SAT solver to feed the problem and examine the output solution. The tool does this by applying multiple solving techniques like unit propagation, pure literal elimination, and intelligent backtracking, among other methods, depending on the complexity of the problem.

Now, let's use a SAT solver to find the solution.

After feeding this problem to the SAT solver, the returned solution indicates that the variables should be assigned truth values as follows: 

Answer: 
-1 -2 3 -4 -5 

This line is read as: Variable 1 and 2 are false (indicated by '-'), and variables 3, 4, and 5 are true. This assignment makes all clauses in the problem true, thereby solving the SAT problem.
