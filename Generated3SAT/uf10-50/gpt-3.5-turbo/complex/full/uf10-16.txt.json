We will start with an empty assignment and proceed with the algorithm recursively.\n2. We will evaluate clauses and repeatedly apply unit propagation (a form of deduction) while unit clauses exist until there are no more such clauses left.\n3. If there are no more unit clauses, we will choose a variable and make an assignment (True/False) to it.\n4. We will repeat steps 2 and 3 until all clauses are satisfied or a contradiction is found.\n5. If we reach a contradiction (empty clause), we backtrack and change the assignment of a variable.\n\nLet's start solving using the DPLL algorithm:\n\n2. -6: make True\n3. 1: make True\n8. 4: make True\n10. 10: make True\n13. -9: make True\n15. -6: Contradiction, backtrack\n16. 6: make False\n17. 1: make True\n19. 9: make True\n20. -7: make False\n21. 10: Contradiction, backtrack\n22. 5: make True\n23. 2: make True\n25. -3: make False\n26. -2: Contradiction, backtrack\n27. 7: make False\n28. 3: make True\n\nThus, a satisfying assignment for this SAT problem is:\nanswer: 6 1 8 4 10 -9 5 2 -3 -7 7 3"
