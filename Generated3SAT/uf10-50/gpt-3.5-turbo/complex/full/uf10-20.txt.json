We will need to assign truth values to the variables in order to satisfy all the clauses.\n\n1. Start with an empty assignment.\n2. Pick a variable to assign a truth value. We will start with variable 1.\n3. Check the clauses and see if any can be satisfied with this assignment. For example, clause 1 can be satisfied if variable 9 is false, variable 10 is true, and variable 3 is true. This satisfies the clause.\n4. Repeat the process for the remaining variables, clauses, and assignments.\n5. If all clauses can be satisfied, then the problem is satisfiable. Otherwise, it is unsatisfiable.\n\nLet's run the DPLL algorithm on the given clauses to find a satisfying assignment.\n\nanswer: This problem is satisfiable."
