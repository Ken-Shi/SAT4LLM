This algorithm randomly selects an unsatisfied clause and then randomly flips the value of a variable in order to try to satisfy the clause. We repeat this process many times, adjusting the probability of choosing random or greedy moves in order to converge towards a solution.\n\nAfter running the WalkSAT algorithm for a number of iterations, we can observe the assignments of variables in its final state. By examining the final state, we can determine if there is a satisfying assignment that satisfies all the clauses.\n\nNow let's run the WalkSAT algorithm on the given DIMACS encoded SAT problem:\n\nanswer: 7 -6 5 -4 3 -2 -1 -10 -9 -8"
