The goal is to find a satisfying assignment to the Boolean variables that makes all the clauses true.\n\nHere's the outline of the WalkSAT algorithm:\n1. Randomly assign truth values to the Boolean variables.\n2. Repeat the following steps until a satisfying assignment is found or a maximum number of iterations is reached:\n   a. Check if any clause is unsatisfied.\n   b. If there is an unsatisfied clause, choose one randomly.\n   c. With a probability p, flip the truth value of a randomly chosen variable in the unsatisfied clause. Otherwise, flip the variable that maximizes the number of satisfied clauses.\n3. If a satisfying assignment is found, stop and output the assignment. Otherwise, output \"unsatisfiable.\"\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format:\n\nanswer: unsatisfiable"
