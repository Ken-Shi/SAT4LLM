To solve the SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm, which is a backtracking algorithm for satisfiability testing. 

First, let's analyze the clauses given:
- There are 10 variables (1-10) and 50 clauses.
- Each clause is disjunction (OR) separated by space, and each line ends with '0'.
- The positive integer represents the variable, and the negative integer represents the negation of the variable in the clause.

Now, we will apply the DPLL algorithm to find a satisfying assignment for the given SAT problem.

**DPLL Algorithm Steps:**
1. We will start with an empty assignment and proceed with the algorithm recursively.
2. We will evaluate clauses and repeatedly apply unit propagation (a form of deduction) while unit clauses exist until there are no more such clauses left.
3. If there are no more unit clauses, we will choose a variable and make an assignment (True/False) to it.
4. We will repeat steps 2 and 3 until all clauses are satisfied or a contradiction is found.
5. If we reach a contradiction (empty clause), we backtrack and change the assignment of a variable.

Let's start solving using the DPLL algorithm:

2. -6: make True
3. 1: make True
8. 4: make True
10. 10: make True
13. -9: make True
15. -6: Contradiction, backtrack
16. 6: make False
17. 1: make True
19. 9: make True
20. -7: make False
21. 10: Contradiction, backtrack
22. 5: make True
23. 2: make True
25. -3: make False
26. -2: Contradiction, backtrack
27. 7: make False
28. 3: make True

Thus, a satisfying assignment for this SAT problem is:
answer: 6 1 8 4 10 -9 5 2 -3 -7 7 3
