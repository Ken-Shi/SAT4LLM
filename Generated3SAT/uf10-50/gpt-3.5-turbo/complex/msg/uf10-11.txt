To solve this SAT problem in DIMACS format, we need to convert the given clauses into conjunctive normal form (CNF) and apply a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment.

The given CNF has 10 variables and 50 clauses. We will use a SAT solver to determine if there exists a truth assignment that satisfies all the clauses.

Let the SAT solver determine if the given CNF is satisfiable or unsatisfiable.

answer: SATISFIABLE
