To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use the WalkSAT algorithm. The goal is to find a satisfying assignment to the Boolean variables that makes all the clauses true.

Here's the outline of the WalkSAT algorithm:
1. Randomly assign truth values to the Boolean variables.
2. Repeat the following steps until a satisfying assignment is found or a maximum number of iterations is reached:
   a. Check if any clause is unsatisfied.
   b. If there is an unsatisfied clause, choose one randomly.
   c. With a probability p, flip the truth value of a randomly chosen variable in the unsatisfied clause. Otherwise, flip the variable that maximizes the number of satisfied clauses.
3. If a satisfying assignment is found, stop and output the assignment. Otherwise, output "unsatisfiable."

Let's apply this algorithm to the given SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format:

answer: unsatisfiable
