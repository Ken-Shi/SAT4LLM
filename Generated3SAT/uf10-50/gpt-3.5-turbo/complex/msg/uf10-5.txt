This problem is represented in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) which is a common way to represent logical expressions. 

We are given 10 variables and 50 clauses in the DIMACS format. Each line represents a clause, with the numbers indicating the variables involved. If a number is positive, it means that variable is included in the clause, while if it is negative, it means the negation of that variable is included.

To solve this SAT problem, we need to find a satisfying assignment of truth values to the variables that make all the clauses true.

Let's use a SAT solver to find the solution.

answer: 3 -2 -6 -8 -10
