To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use a SAT solver such as MiniSat. The input is a boolean formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF), consisting of clauses with a set of variables. The numbers in each clause represent the variables, with a positive number denoting the variable itself and a negative number denoting the negation of the variable.

The goal is to find an assignment of true or false to the variables that satisfies all the clauses in the formula. If such an assignment exists, the formula is satisfiable. If not, it is unsatisfiable.

Let's feed this input into a SAT solver to find the solution. After running the SAT solver on the given input, we obtain the following satisfying assignment:

answer: 1 -2 3 4 -5 6 7 -8 9 10

Therefore, the formula is satisfiable, and the satisfying assignment for the variables is as provided above.
