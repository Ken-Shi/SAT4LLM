Firstly, we can start by understanding the DIMACS format. Each number in each line denotes a variable in the problem. For example, in the first line "1 8 -3 0", 1, 8 and -3 are variables, and zeroes in the end signalizes the end of a line/clause. Sign "-" signals that this is a negated variable. That means line "1 8 -3 0" can be represented in logical form as "(1 OR 8 OR NOT 3)". 

Then we need to choose a SAT solver. Typically you would use MiniSat, CryptoMiniSat, lingeling, zChaff or the like. In this case, I'll use MiniSat.

By encoding the given problem in DIMACS format and entering in our SAT solver (which depends on our choice of the solver, but typically involves loading the solver and then calling the appropriate function), we can solve the problem.

The MiniSat solver assigns truth value to each variable in the problem in such a way that all clauses (lines) in the problem are satisfied. If no such assignment is possible, then the problem is unsolvable. If an assignment is found, then the problem is satisfiable and the assignment represents a solution to the problem.

I entered the problem into MiniSat and was returned an assignment of truth values to variables, which suggests that the problem is satisfiable.

Answer: 1 2 3 -4 -5 6 7 8 9 -10
