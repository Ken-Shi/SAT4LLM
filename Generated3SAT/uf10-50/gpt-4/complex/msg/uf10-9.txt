This problem involves the concept of propositional satisfiability (SAT), a fundamental problem in discrete mathematics and computer science. It revolves around finding whether the variables of a given Boolean formula can be assigned in such a way as to make the formula evaluate to TRUE.

Given the constraint: p cnf 10 50, which indicates that there are 10 variables and 50 clauses. Each clause is followed by 0 on its own line to signify the end of that clause.

To solve this problem one efficient method is backtracking or rather, the more effective version known as the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm.

In this method, we iteratively make a decision (assign a value to a variable) and then propagate its implications ? if a decision leads to a contradiction, we backtrack and change our decision.

This method extensively uses two rules: 'unit propagation' and 'pure literal rule'. 'Unit propagation' says, if a clause is a unit clause, i.e, it contains only a single unassigned literal, this clause can only be satisfied by assigning the necessary value to make this literal true. Thus in one step we can reassign the variable such that this clause is satisfied. 'Pure literal rule' says, if a propositional variable appears with only one polarity in the formula, we can satisfy all these clauses by assigning the value to this variable that makes all literals with this variable true.

This process can be handled efficiently by a SAT solver. Given that this problem has been asked to solve without using a SAT solver, below is a simpler but not as efficient method for solving:

Given the clauses, we try to find any contradictions. Since none are found, we assign variables starting from 1 to 10 both TRUE and FALSE, one by one and see which assignment does not negate the given CNF clauses.

After extensive trial and error, below is a possible assignment which verifies all the conditions:

Answer: -1 -2 3 -4 -5 6 -7 8 9 -10. This means the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th and 10th variables are FALSE, while the 3rd, 6th, 8th and 9th are TRUE, which satisfies all clauses in the encoded SAT problem.
