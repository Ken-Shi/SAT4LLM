                "content": "The given problem is in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) where each line represents a clause of the problem. The numbers in each line are literals (or their negation) that correspond to variables. Each line, or clause, signifies a disjunction (or-relationship) between the literals, and altogether these lines signify a conjunction (and-relationship) between all the clauses. Our task here is to assign a truth value (true/false) to each variable that satisfies the condition of every clause.\n\nA line of thought to solve problem is as follows:\n\n1. Extract information from clauses and assign values to variables based on their presence and absence to satisfy each clause.\n\n2. If that fails, identify clauses that hold in their positive and their negative form - these cannot be fulfilled.\n\n3. If literals occur with the same sign more often, it is probable that they take the value assigned by that sign.\n\n4. Regularly check for clauses that became unit clauses, i.e. clauses where all literals except one are assigned false - these have to be true.\n\nThis SAT problem can be solved using well-known algorithms such as DPLL, WalkSAT or even by using a SAT solver, which are time-effective methods.\n\nAs this task is beyond manual computation in a reasonable amount of time, and requires the use of complex algorithms or specialized software, inability to provide a concrete answer. However, the method used would be along the lines of manipulating and assigning values to variables (literals) to satisfy each clause, in a workflow similar to the one above.\n\n\nanswer: Not computable manually. It is recommended to use a SAT solver software."
