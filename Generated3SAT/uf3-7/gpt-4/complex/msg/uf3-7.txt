The provided question is a problem from the area of Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), this problem is represented in the DIMACS format, which is a standard way to represent Boolean expressions. The given problem is constructed using 3 variables and a conjunction of 7 clauses.

Let?s go step by step through this problem:
First, in "p cnf 3 7" the 3 stands for the variables which are represented by the digits 1, 2, 3, and their negations -1, -2, -3 stand for the negation of these variables. 7 stands for the number of clauses or lines which are mentioned afterward.

Each line after the problem declaration, ending with a 0, represents a different clause of the problem. For example, in the line "2 1 -3 0", it represents the clause ?(2 OR 1 OR NOT 3)?.

Now to solve this we are looking for a solution that will satisfy every clause. This means that for every clause we should find at least one TRUE literal. 

Let's break this down:
2 1 -3 0 --> Not 3 gives a true because of a negative, so this is satisfied.
3 2 1 0 --> Here only one literal needs to be true. If we take 3 as true, this clause will be satisfied.
2 1 3 0 --> Here if we take 3 as true, this also ends in a true clause.
2 1 3 0 --> Same goes for this clause.
3 1 2 0 --> We already have 3 as true, so this clause is also satisfied.
3 -2 1 0 -->Here we have a situation. In this clause we have -2 so if we check against other clauses where 2 is required to be true, this clause will become false. So in this case, our variables 1 or 3 should be true, which they are already.
3 2 1 0 --> we have 3 and 1 as true, so this clause is satisfied.

So this is true if every clause has at least one true literal, which in this case it is. 

The conclusion:

Taking variable 1=true, variable 2=true, variable 3=true. Or in terms of integers 1, 2, and 3.

Answer: 1,2,3
