The problem provided is a Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT problem) which is defined in conjunctive normal form (CNF) and encoded using DIMACS format. 

The first line in the problem "p cnf 3 7" signifies that there are 3 variables and 7 clauses in the problem. The variables are represented as integers from 1 to 3. Negation of a variable is represented by a negative sign (e.g. '-2' signifies 'not 2').

The next 7 lines are the 7 different clauses in the problem, each ending with a '0'. Each clause is made up of literals (variables or their negation) and can be interpreted as a disjunction (OR operation) of the literals. For the overall CNF problem, the clauses are in conjunction (AND operation) with each other.

The task is to determine if there is an assignment of these boolean variables that makes the whole formula true.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we can observe that '(3 -2 1)' and '(3 -2 -1)' cannot be true at the same time. However, since we have a duplicate of the first clause, we can ignore the second one.

2. The clause '(-2 3 1)' can be true if '2' is false, '3' is true, or '1' is true. Since '2' can be false, it means '3' can be true. That is, '2' is false and '3' is true.

3. The clause '(-2 -3 1)' can be true if '2' is false, '3' is false, or '1' is true. But we already know that '3' is true, therefore '1' must be true for this clause to hold.

4. The clause '(2 3 1)' can be true if '2' is true, or '3' is true, or '1' is true. Given we already know that '3' is true and '1' is true, this clause is automatically true, regardless the value of '2'.

Hence, we propose that '2' is false (or can have any value because it does not affect the overall result), '3' is true and '1' is true.

Let us check the assignment back into the problem:

- '(3 -2 1)' evaluates to 'true OR false OR true', which is true.
- '(-2 3 1)' evaluates to 'true OR true OR true', which is true.
- '(3 -2 1)' evaluates to 'true OR false OR true', which is true.
- '(-2 -3 1)' evaluates to 'true OR false OR true', which is true.
- '(3 -2 -1)' evaluates to 'true OR false OR false', which is true.
- '(2 3 1)' evaluates to 'false OR true OR true', which is true.

With this assignment, all clauses are satisfied, meaning the entire CNF formula is satisfied.

Answer: 2 = FALSE, 3 = TRUE, 1 = TRUE
