To solve this SAT problem, we'll use the method of correctness propagation, or unit propagation. 

1. The first clause is '-3 -2 -1 0', meaning at least one of [1, 2, 3] must be false. 

2. The second clause is '3 -2 1 0'. Since clause 1 requires at least one of [1, 2, 3] to be false, but clause 2 needs either 3 or 1 to be true (or both), we can deduce that 2 must be false, as that would satisfy both clauses.

3. Now knowing that 2 is false, we can simplify some other clauses. The third clause '1 3 -2 0' can be simplified to '1 3 0', since -2 is already satisfied.

4. The fourth and fifth clauses '-3 1 -2 0' and '-3 -1 -2 0' can both be simplified to '-3 1 0', since -2 is already satisfied in these as well. From this, we can determine that 1 must be true to satisfy these clauses.

5. The sixth clause '3 -2 1 0' is already satisfied, since we know 1 is true and 2 is false.

6. The final clause is '3 1 2 0'. Knowing that 2 is false, we also now know 3 must be true to satisfy this clause.

So, 1 is true, 2 is false, and 3 is true.

Answer: 1=true, 2=false, 3=true.
