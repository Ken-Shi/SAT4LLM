In the given SAT problem, we have the following clauses:

1) -2 V 3 V 1
2) 2 V -1 V -3
3) -3 V -2 V -1
4) 2 V -3 V -1
5) -1 V -3 V -2
6) -1 V -3 V -2
7) -3 V -2 V -1

Here, a positive number represents the existence of a variable and a negative number represents the absence of a variable.

When considering the first clause, we can initially assign -2 as FALSE (which means 2 is TRUE), 3 as TRUE, and 1 as TRUE.

Heading on to the second clause, because we already assigned 2 as TRUE, so the whole clause is also TRUE.

As for the third clause, because we earlier determined 1 and 2 to be TRUE, for this clause to be TRUE, we must set -3 as TRUE, indicating 3 is FALSE.

Next, looking at the fourth clause, because 2 is TRUE and -3 is TRUE, the clause is TRUE.

In the fifth clause, -3 is already TRUE, so the whole clause is TRUE. This also applies for the last two clauses.

In order for this SAT problem to be solvable, all clauses need to evaluate to TRUE. The assignments mentioned above ensure this, making this the solution for this particular SAT problem.

In summary, we assign 1 as TRUE, 2 as TRUE, and 3 as FALSE.

Answer: 1=True, 2=True, 3=False
