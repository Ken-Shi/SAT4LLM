Solving a SAT problem is a complex process which involves logical reasoning and combinatorial search. Here's how to approach this specific problem:

1. Reading the Input:
The first line "p cnf 3 7" tells us that it's a CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) formulation with 3 variables and 7 clauses. The following lines are the clauses, consisting of literals (variables or their negations). A zero (0) marks the end of a clause.

2. Build Understanding:
We try to understand the clauses in common language. 
 a) 3 -2 1 0 can be read as "Either variable 3 is True, or 2 is False, or 1 is True."
 b) 1 -2 -3 0 can be read as "Either variable 1 is True, or 2 is False, or 3 is False."

3. Apply Reasoning:
We follow a systematic approach, known as the Davis-Putnam procedure, to find a solution to the SAT problem. The algorithm makes a series of deduction and backtracking steps. It selects a variable, assigns it a Boolean value (either true or false), and simplifies the problem. If a contradiction is reached, it backtracks and tries the other Boolean value for the variable.

4. Find Contradictions:
On careful observation, you notice that clause 3, 4 and 5 contradict each other. In clause 3, if variable 1 is False, then 3 must be True. However, this contradicts clause 4 where if variable 1 is False, then 3 must be False. And, in clause 5, if variable 2 is False, then 3 must be True, contradicting clause 4 again.

Therefore, one of the intuition draws us to the conclusion that variable 1 must be True. 

5. Following the Implications:
After setting the value of variable 1, we'll substitute it into the given formulations to further simplify our problem. We can deduce that variable 2 must be False from clause 1, 3, and 6 since variable 3 can not be False, according to clause 5. Then, we check clause 2 which becomes -1 or -3, implying 3 should be true given that 1 is true, consistent with all other clauses.

Therefore, the solution is 1=True, 2=False and 3=True.

Answer: 1 -2 3
