Solution Method:

The given problem is in DIMACS format which is a standard file format for specifying problems in CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form). It is used for problems that are typically solved by SAT solvers.
Each row in the given problem encodes a clause in the corresponding CNF expression. 

Our goal is to solve the problem by finding a valid assignment of truth values (true or false) to the variables 1, 2 and 3 such that the entire CNF expression is true.

We can solve the problem step by step as follows:

1. Look at the first clause (2 3 -1 0), this clause is true if at least one of literals '2', '3', or 'not 1' (-1) is true.
2. With the same reasoning, we can interpret the rest of the clauses.
3. A literal is either a variable or its negation, literal '2' is true when variable '2' is true, and literal '-2' is true when variable '2' is false.

Through quick observation we can see that literal '2' appears in all clauses, which means that we must make literal '2' true so all the clauses are true. 

To do that, we set variable '2' = true, '1' = false and '3' = true. This assignment of values make every clause true (since at least one literal in every clause is true) and therefore makes the entire CNF expression true.

Answer: 1=false, 2=true, 3=true.
