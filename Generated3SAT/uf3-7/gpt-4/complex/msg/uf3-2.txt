The problem provided is a Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT problem) written in the DIMACS format - a standard format used for encoding SAT problems. This problem specifically includes 3 variables (1, 2 and 3) and 7 clauses.

The problem can be rewritten in a more human-readable way as:

* Clause 1:  (x1 OR NOT x3 OR x2) 
* Clause 2:  (x1 OR NOT x2 OR NOT x3) 
* Clause 3:  (NOT x2 OR NOT x3 OR x1) 
* Clause 4:  (NOT x3 OR NOT x2 OR x1) 
* Clause 5:  (NOT x2 OR NOT x3 OR x1) 
* Clause 6:  (NOT x2 OR x1 OR NOT x3)  
* Clause 7:  (NOT x2 OR NOT x3 OR x1) 

When a positive number (x) appears in a clause, it means that variable (x) is present. When a negative number (NOT x) appears in a clause, it signifies the negation of the variable.

Each clause represents a disjunction (OR operation), and the entire problem is a conjunction (AND operation) of all the clauses - meaning, for the set of variables to satisfy the problem, it must satisfy all clauses simultaneously.

To solve this problem manually, we will use the method of systematic trial and error.

First, let's see what will happen if we set x1 = True, x2 = False, x3 = True:

Clause 1: True OR False OR False = True
Clause 2: True OR True OR False = True
Clause 3: True OR False OR True = True
Clause 4: True OR True OR True = True
Clause 5: True OR False OR True = True
Clause 6: True OR True OR False = True
Clause 7: True OR False OR True = True 

As all clauses return "true", this combination of variable values satisfies the given problem.

Answer: x1 = True, x2 = False, x3 = True
