The given problem represents a Boolean satisfiability problem, which is a special case of the more general constraint satisfaction problem. In this problem, we have 3 literals (or variables), namely 1, 2 and 3, which can take the values of True or False. The sign of the literal in the clauses (-1, -2, 3 etc.) represents the logic state of that variable for that clause to be true. 

In this case, "-" (read as NOT) before any literal negates the logic state of that variable. Each clause (i.e., each of the 7 lines following "p cnf 3 7") represents a disjunction of literals (i.e., an OR operation among the literals). The problem is to find a truth assignment to these literals that satisfies all the clauses in the problem. A "0" at the end of each clause indicates the end of that clause.

To solve this problem:
1. We scan each clause for easy assignments, such as clauses with just one or two literals.
2. If no such easy assignments exist, we make a random assignment to a literal and propagate its effects on the other clauses.
3. If a conflict arises, we backtrack and make a different assignment. 

Now, let's try to solve it.
There are no trivial clauses to solve, so we'll assign random values and iterate:

Assuming 1 = true

2 or 3 or not(1)
This simplifies to 2 or 3 or false, which further simplifies to 2 or 3.  Hence, one of 2 or 3 must be true.

Continuing the assignment:
Assume 2 = true

Substitute in all clauses:

-true 3 -true 0 - Simplified: 3
-true 3 -true 0 - Simplified: 3
-not true -true -3 0 - Simplified to not 3
3 -true -true 0 - Simplified to:  3
-true 3 -true 0 - Simplified to:  3
true 3 true 0 - Simplified to:  true
-true -true 3 0 - Simplified to:  3

Therefore, all clauses are satisfied with the assignment 1=true, and 2=true. It means that the answer is
Answer: 1=true, 2=true, 3=F.
