In the given problem, we have 3 variables and 7 clauses (or conditions). The variables are represented as '1', '2', and '3'. The negative sign in front of a variable shows that it is in the negated state (for example, '-2' is read as 'not 2'). Zero at the end of a line signifies the end of a clause.

Let's start solving by going through each clause one at a time:

1. Clause 1: This clause has '3', '-1', and '-2'. This means that either '3' is True, or '1' is False, or '2' is False.

2. Clause 2 and 4: These clauses have '-2', '3', '1' which means either '2' is False or '3' is True or '1' is True and '1','-2' and '3' which means either '1' is True or '2' is false or '3' is true. 

3. Clause 3: This clause has '-2', '-1', and '3'. This means either '2' is False, or '1' is False, or '3' is True.

4. Clause 5: This clause has '3', '1' and '-2'. This means either '3' is True, or '1' is True, or '2' is False.

Looking at all of these clauses, it seems like the solution can be '3' is True, '1' is True and '2' is False because this combination satisfies all the clauses.

Answer: 3=True, 1=True, 2=False.
