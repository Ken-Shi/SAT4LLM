This is a classic application of the SAT (Satisfiability) problem, which belongs to the class of NP-complete problems in computer science. The SAT problem is a decision problem that aims to determine if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given Boolean formula. The DIMACS format is a standard for writing SAT instances, in which a true literal is represented by a positive integer, and a false literal is represented by a negative integer. 

These are clauses in conjunctive normal form (CNF). Each clause is disjunctive (an OR of literals), and the entire problem is the conjunction (an AND of clauses).

Let's decode the DIMACS format:

p cnf 3 7: Indicates that there are 3 variables and 7 clauses.

The remaining lines represent the clauses:
1. (3 OR 1 OR 2) (This means at least one of these literals must be true)
2. (NOT 1 OR NOT 2 OR 3) 
3. (NOT 3 OR NOT 2 OR 1)
4. (1 OR 3 OR 2)
5. (1 OR 2 OR 3)
6. (3 OR NOT 1 OR NOT 2)
7. (NOT 3 OR 2 OR 1)

To satisfy a CNF, each clause must be satisfied. A clause is satisfied if at least one literal is true. One satisfying assignment can be found by a truth-table search approach, which tests all possible assignments, systematic trial and error or using a SAT solver tool.

Looking at the clauses, we can identify a truth assignment that satisfies each clause. Here's how:

1: The truth assignment {1=true, 2=true, 3=true}, satisfy all the clauses as at least one of the literals in each clause is true.                    
   
Answer: 

1 = True
2 = True
3 = True

This means all the variables 1, 2, and 3 need to be true in order to satisfy all the given clauses. 
(Important: there could be multiple possible solutions to this problem. This is just one possible solution.)
