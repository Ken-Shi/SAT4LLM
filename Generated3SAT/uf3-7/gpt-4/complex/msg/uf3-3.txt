This is a 3-SAT problem with three variables (1, 2, 3) and seven clauses. Variable '1' is represented as '1', and its negation is represented as '-1', and so on for other variables. Each clause is a disjunction (OR operation) of three literals (a variable or its negation) that ends with '0'. The entire problem is a conjunction (AND operation) of these seven clauses.

Looking closely at the clauses, we can see that there are common literals among them that keep repeating.

Let's look at the clauses one by one:

-3 -2 1 0 -> this means NOT 3 OR NOT 2 OR 1
1 2 -3 0 -> this means 1 OR 2 OR NOT 3
-2 1 -3 0 -> this means NOT 2 OR 1 OR NOT 3 
1 -3 2 0 -> this means 1 OR NOT 3 OR 2
-1 -2 -3 0 -> this means NOT 1 OR NOT 2 OR NOT 3
-3 1 -2 0 -> this means NOT 3 OR 1 OR NOT 2 
-2 1 3 0 -> this means NOT 2 OR 1 OR 3 

If we make the variable 1 as True, variable 2 as False and variable 3 as False, you'll see that all clauses are satisfied. 

We can confirm this by replacing the symbols with these values in all clauses:

-3 -2 1 0 -> NOT False OR NOT False OR True == True
1 2 -3 0 -> True OR False OR NOT False == True
-2 1 -3 0 -> NOT False OR True OR NOT False == True
1 -3 2 0 -> True OR NOT False OR False == True
-1 -2 -3 0 -> NOT True OR NOT False OR NOT False == True
-3 1 -2 0 -> NOT False OR True OR NOT False == True
-2 1 3 0 -> NOT False OR True OR False == True

Hence, all clauses are true, making the whole 3-SAT problem True.

So, in this case, one solution to the given 3-SAT problem could be:

Answer: Variable 1=True, Variable 2=False, Variable 3=False
