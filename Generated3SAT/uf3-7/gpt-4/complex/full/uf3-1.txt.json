                "content": "This SAT problem includes three variables and seven clauses (also referred to as conjunctions).\nHere is a mapping of variables: x1 = 1, x2 = 2 and x3 = 3.\n\nFirst, a clause-by-clause analysis:\n\n1. -2 -1 -3 0: This clause indicates that at least one of x2, x1 or x3 must be FALSE.\n2. -3 2 -1 0: This clause indicates that at least one of x3, x2 or x1 must be FALSE.\n3. 2 -3 -1 0: This clause indicates that at least one of x2, x3 or x1 must be TRUE.\n4. -3 2 -1 0: This is a repetition of the 2nd clause.\n5. 3 2 -1 0: This clause indicates that at least one of x3, x2 or x1 must be TRUE.\n6. -3 1 2 0: This clause indicates that at least one of x3, x1 or x2 must be FALSE.\n7. -1 2 -3 0: This clause indicates that at least one of x1, x2, or x3 must be FALSE.\n\nNext, we have to look at possible combinations that satisfy all these clauses (i.e., all of them being true).\n\nThe clauses basically tell us that we cannot have ALL variables (x1, x2, x3) be true (1st clause) or false (3rd clause).\n\nA possible combination that satisfies all the clauses is x1 = False, x2 = True, and x3 = False. If we substitute these values into each clause, we can see that every clause may be fulfilled:\n\n1. -x2 -x1 -x3 0: False\n2. -x3 x2 -x1 0: True\n3. x2 -x3 -x1 0: True\n4. -x3 x2 -x1 0: True\n5. x3 x2 -x1 0: True\n6. -x3 x1 x2 0: True\n7. -x1 x2 -x3 0: True\n\nThis means that the proposed solution is viable that is x1=False, x2=True, and x3=False\n\nAnswer: x1=False, x2=True, x3=False"
