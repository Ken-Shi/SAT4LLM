                "content": "This problem is a conjunctive normal form (CNF) Boolean satisfiability problem. We are given three variables (3) and seven clauses. We need to find a solution that satisfies all clauses. \n\nSteps:\n1. Each clause is a disjunction of literals (either a variable or its negation). \n2. Each line in the provided data represents one clause and ends with Zero (0).\n3. A negative sign (-) before a number means the negation of the corresponding variable.\n\nBreaking down clauses:\n- First clause: It means (NOT variable 2 OR variable 3 OR variable 1). We need at least one of them  to be True to satisfy the clause.\n- Second clause: It is identical to first clause. We still need at least one of them to be True.\n- Third clause: It means (NOT variable 3 OR variable 1 OR NOT variable 2). We need at least one of them to be True.\n- Fourth clause: It means (NOT variable 2 OR variable 1 OR variable 3). We need at least one of them to be True.\n- Fifth clause: It means (variable 3 OR NOT variable 2 OR variable 1). We need at least one of them to be True.\n- Sixth clause: It means (variable 1 OR variable 3 OR variable 2). We need at least one of them to be True.\n- Seventh clause: It means (variable 1 OR NOT variable 2 OR variable 3). We need at least one of them to be True.\n\nObserving these clauses, there are obvious repetitions, and all the clauses have either variable 1 or its negation (which is not actually present in these clauses). So if we assume variable 1 as True, all our clauses can be satisfied.\n\nNo single variable appears as a literal across all clauses, hence focusing one variable at a time would be the quickest approach here. Also, none of the variables had to be made False to satisfy all clauses, hence we can possibly explore making other variables False in cases where required.\n\nAnswer: Variable1 = True, Variable2 = True, Variable3 = True."
