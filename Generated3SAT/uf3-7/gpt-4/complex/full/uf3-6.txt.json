                "content": "The given problem is a 3-SAT problem which can be solved using backtracking or using SAT solvers. \n\nSAT problem is a decision problem where we have to check if there exists a valid assignment of variables that would satisfy all clauses in the Boolean formula. Since the formula is in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), it means it is a conjunction of several clauses, where each clause is a disjunction of literals.\n\nEach line (after the first line with \"p cnf 3 7\") represents a clause. The integers represent literals, where a negative number represents the negation of a variable. \"0\" marks the end of a clause.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\nClause 1: `-2 -1 3 0` translates to `(!x2 OR !x1 OR x3)`\n\nClause 2: `-3 -1 -2 0` translates to `(!x3 OR !x1 OR !x2)`\n\nClause 3: `-3 -2 1 0` translates to `(!x3 OR !x2 OR x1)`\n\nClause 4: `2 3 -1 0` translates to `(x2 OR x3 OR !x1)`\n\nClause 5: `3 -1 -2 0` translates to `(x3 OR !x1 OR !x2)`\n\nClause 6: `-2 -1 3 0` translates to `(!x2 OR !x1 OR x3)`\n\nClause 7: `3 -1 -2 0` translates to `(x3 OR !x1 OR !x2)`\n\nNote that Clause 1 and Clause 6 are identical, as well as Clause 5 and Clause 7.\n\nWe want to find if there are values for `x1, x2, x3` that satisfy all the clauses simultaneously.\n\nA possible solution is `x1=True, x2=False, x3=True`. This assignment works for all clauses. In actual SAT solving, systematic methods (like backtracking, unit propagation) or programs (SAT solvers) are employed to find a solution reliably and efficiently, but for problems of this size, the solution can be found manually without much difficulty.\n\nAnswer: x1=True, x2=False, x3=True."
