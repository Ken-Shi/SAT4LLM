The first clause is '-3 -2 -1 0', meaning at least one of [1, 2, 3] must be false. \n\n2. The second clause is '3 -2 1 0'. Since clause 1 requires at least one of [1, 2, 3] to be false, but clause 2 needs either 3 or 1 to be true (or both), we can deduce that 2 must be false, as that would satisfy both clauses.\n\n3. Now knowing that 2 is false, we can simplify some other clauses. The third clause '1 3 -2 0' can be simplified to '1 3 0', since -2 is already satisfied.\n\n4. The fourth and fifth clauses '-3 1 -2 0' and '-3 -1 -2 0' can both be simplified to '-3 1 0', since -2 is already satisfied in these as well. From this, we can determine that 1 must be true to satisfy these clauses.\n\n5. The sixth clause '3 -2 1 0' is already satisfied, since we know 1 is true and 2 is false.\n\n6. The final clause is '3 1 2 0'. Knowing that 2 is false, we also now know 3 must be true to satisfy this clause.\n\nSo, 1 is true, 2 is false, and 3 is true.\n\nAnswer: 1=true, 2=false, 3=true."
