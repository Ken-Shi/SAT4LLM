This also applies for the last two clauses.\n\nIn order for this SAT problem to be solvable, all clauses need to evaluate to TRUE. The assignments mentioned above ensure this, making this the solution for this particular SAT problem.\n\nIn summary, we assign 1 as TRUE, 2 as TRUE, and 3 as FALSE.\n\nAnswer: 1=True, 2=True, 3=False"
