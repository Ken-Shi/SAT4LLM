(1 2 -3) - This means either variable 1 and 2 are true and variable 3 is false or vice versa.\n2. (-3 2 1) - This means either variable 3 is false and variables 2, 1 are true or vice versa.\n3. (1 3 2) - This means either variable 1, 3 are true and variable 2 is true.\n4. (1 2 -3) - Same as 1.\n5. (1 -2 -3) - This means variable 1 is true and either variable 2 or 3 are false.\n6. (1 -2 3) - This means variable 1 is true and either variable 2 is false or variable 3 is true.\n7. (-3 2 1) - Same as 2.\n\nFrom these clauses, we can see that the only way to satisfy all clauses simultaneously is to assign:\n- variable 1 as true\n- variable 2 as false\n- variable 3 as false\n\nTherefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:\nanswer: 1 -2 -3"
