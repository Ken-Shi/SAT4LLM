Let's analyze each clause.\n\n1. Clause: -2 3 1\nThis clause can be satisfied by assigning variable 2 as false, variable 3 as true, and variable 1 as true.\n\n2. Clause: -2 3 1\nThis clause is the same as the first clause and can also be satisfied by the same assignment.\n\n3. Clause: -3 1 -2\nThis clause can be satisfied by assigning variable 3 as false, variable 1 as true, and variable 2 as false.\n\n4. Clause: -2 1 3\nThis clause can be satisfied by assigning variable 2 as false, variable 1 as true, and variable 3 as true.\n\n5. Clause: 3 -2 1\nThis clause can be satisfied by assigning variable 3 as true, variable 2 as false, and variable 1 as true.\n\n6. Clause: 1 3 2\nThis clause can be satisfied by assigning variable 1 as true, variable 3 as true, and variable 2 as true.\n\n7. Clause: 1 -2 3\nThis clause can be satisfied by assigning variable 1 as true, variable 2 as false, and variable 3 as true.\n\nTherefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:\nanswer: 1 -2 3"
