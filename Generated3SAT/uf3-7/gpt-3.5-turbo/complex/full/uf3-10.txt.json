Let's start with the assumption that variable 1 is True, variable 2 is False, and variable 3 is True:\n    - This assignment satisfies clauses 1, 4, and 6. \n    - However, it does not satisfy clauses 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n    \n2. Next, let's try variable 1 as False, variable 2 as True, and variable 3 as False:\n    - This assignment satisfies clauses 3, 5, and 7.\n    - However, it does not satisfy clauses 1, 2, 4, and 6.\n    \n3. Lastly, let's try variable 1 as True, variable 2 as True, and variable 3 as False:\n    - This assignment satisfies clauses 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n    - However, it does not satisfy clauses 1, 6, and 7.\n    \nSince none of the above assignments satisfy all the clauses, the given CNF is unsatisfiable.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nanswer: UNSATISFIABLE"
