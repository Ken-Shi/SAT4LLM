                "content": "To solve this SAT problem, we first list out the clauses:\n1. (-3 -2 1)\n2. (1 2 -3)\n3. (-2 1 -3)\n4. (1 -3 2)\n5. (-1 -2 -3)\n6. (-3 1 -2)\n7. (-2 1 3)\n\nWe have 3 variables and 7 clauses. Now, we can start evaluating the clauses to see if there is a satisfying assignment.\n\nFor clause 1 (-3 -2 1): None of the literals can be true at the same time, so this clause is unsatisfiable.\n\nFor clause 2 (1 2 -3): At least one literal must be true. If we set all literals to false, this clause is unsatisfied.\n\nFor clause 3 (-2 1 -3): At least one literal must be true. If we set all literals to false, this clause is unsatisfied.\n\nFor clause 4 (1 -3 2): At least one literal must be true. If we set all literals to false, this clause is unsatisfied.\n\nFor clause 5 (-1 -2 -3): At least one literal must be true. If we set all literals to false, this clause is unsatisfied.\n\nFor clause 6 (-3 1 -2): At least one literal must be true. If we set all literals to false, this clause is unsatisfied.\n\nFor clause 7 (-2 1 3): At least one literal must be true. If we set all literals to false, this clause is unsatisfied.\n\nSince all of the clauses are unsatisfiable, this SAT problem does not have a solution.\n\nanswer: UNSATISFIABLE"
