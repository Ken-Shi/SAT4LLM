(1 OR -2 OR 3)\n3. (3 OR 1 OR -2)\n4. (1 OR -2 OR 3)\n5. (-2 OR 1 OR 3)\n6. (3 OR 1 OR -2)\n7. (3 OR 1 OR -2)\n\nNow, let's try to find a satisfying assignment:\n- For clause 1: Assume 3 is True, this makes the whole clause True.\n- For clause 2: Assume 1 is True, this makes the whole clause True.\n- For clause 3: Assume 3 is True, this makes the whole clause True.\n- For clause 4: Assume 1 is True, this makes the whole clause True.\n- For clause 5: Assume -2 is True, this makes the whole clause True.\n- For clause 6: Assume 3 is True, this makes the whole clause True.\n- For clause 7: Assume 3 is True, this makes the whole clause True.\n\nTherefore, the satisfying assignment is: 1=True, 2=False, 3=True.\n\nanswer: 1=False, 2=True, 3=True"
