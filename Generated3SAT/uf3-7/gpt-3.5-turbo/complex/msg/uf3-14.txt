To solve this SAT problem, we will first break down the CNF format:
- The problem has 3 variables and 7 clauses.
- The clauses are as follows:
1. NOT 2 OR 3 OR NOT 1
2. NOT 1 OR 3 OR NOT 2
3. NOT 2 OR NOT 1 OR NOT 3
4. 3 OR NOT 1 OR NOT 2
5. NOT 1 OR 3 OR NOT 2
6. 2 OR 3 OR 1
7. NOT 1 OR NOT 2 OR 3

To solve this problem, we can apply the DPLL algorithm to find a satisfying assignment for the variables. Let's go through the clauses step by step:

1. We can set variable 1 to False, as clause 1 is satisfied by setting variable 1 to False.
2. After setting variable 1 to False, clauses 2, 4, and 5 become irrelevant since they contain variable 1.
3. We observe that clause 3 is violated because setting variable 1 to False does not satisfy it.
4. After assigning variable 1 to False, we can set variable 3 to True to satisfy clause 3.
5. After setting variables 1 and 3, clause 6 is satisfied, as 2 OR 3 OR 1 is True with variables 2 and 3.
6. Finally, clause 7 is also satisfied with the current assignment of variables.

Therefore, the satisfying assignment for this SAT problem is:
- Variable 1 is False
- Variable 2 is True
- Variable 3 is True

answer: 1 -2 3
