To solve this SAT problem, we will go through each clause and try to find a satisfying assignment that makes all clauses true.

The DIMACS formula is as follows:
p cnf 3 7
3 -1 -2 0
-2 3 1 0
-2 -1 3 0
1 -2 3 0
3 1 -2 0
-2 3 1 0
-2 3 1 0

Let's analyze each clause:
1. (3, -1, -2) -> This means either 3 is true, or -1, or -2. One of them being true will make the clause true.
2. (-2, 3, 1) -> Either -2 or 3 or 1 needs to be true for this clause to be satisfied.
3. (-2, -1, 3) -> Either -2 or -1 or 3 should be true to satisfy this clause.
4. (1, -2, 3) -> Either 1 or -2 or 3 should be true for this clause.
5. (3, 1, -2) -> Similar to previous clauses, one of the variables needs to be true.
6. (-2, 3, 1) -> Repeated clause.
7. (-2, 3, 1) -> Repeated clause.

There is no assignment that can satisfy all the clauses simultaneously. Therefore, the problem is unsatisfiable.

answer: unsatisfiable
