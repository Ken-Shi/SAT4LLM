To solve this problem, we first need to analyze the given CNF in DIMACS format:

p cnf 3 7
3 1 2 0
-1 -2 3 0
-3 -2 1 0
1 3 2 0
1 2 3 0
3 -1 -2 0
-3 2 1 0

The first line indicates that there are 3 variables and 7 clauses.

We can represent the given CNF in a matrix form as below (with variables as columns and clauses as rows):
1, 2, 3
3, 1, 0
1, -2, 3
-2, -1, 3
1, 2, 3
1, 2, 3
-2, -1, 3

Now, let's try to find a satisfying assignment by trying combinations of True/False values for variables 1, 2, and 3:

1. Let's start with the assumption that variable 1 is True, variable 2 is False, and variable 3 is True:
    - This assignment satisfies clauses 1, 4, and 6. 
    - However, it does not satisfy clauses 2, 3, 5, and 7.
    
2. Next, let's try variable 1 as False, variable 2 as True, and variable 3 as False:
    - This assignment satisfies clauses 3, 5, and 7.
    - However, it does not satisfy clauses 1, 2, 4, and 6.
    
3. Lastly, let's try variable 1 as True, variable 2 as True, and variable 3 as False:
    - This assignment satisfies clauses 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    - However, it does not satisfy clauses 1, 6, and 7.
    
Since none of the above assignments satisfy all the clauses, the given CNF is unsatisfiable.

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: UNSATISFIABLE
