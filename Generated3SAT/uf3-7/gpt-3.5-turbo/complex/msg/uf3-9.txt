To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we first need to understand the format:
- The first line "p cnf 3 7" indicates that there are 3 variables and 7 clauses.
- Each subsequent line represents a clause, with the numbers indicating the literals. A "0" at the end of each line denotes the end of the clause.

Next, we can analyze the clauses:
1. Clause: -3 -2 -1
2. Clause: 3 -2 1
3. Clause: 1 3 -2
4. Clause: -3 1 -2
5. Clause: -3 -1 -2
6. Clause: 3 -2 1
7. Clause: 3 1 2

From these clauses, we see that variable 2 appears in all clauses and has both positive and negative occurrences. In order to satisfy these clauses, we need to assign variable 2 to true.

Subsequently, we can simplify the clauses and remove any clauses that contain variable 2, as it is already assigned. This leaves us with:
1. Clause: 1
2. Clause: -3 -1
3. Clause: 1

Now, we can see that variable 1 also appears in all remaining clauses and has both positive and negative occurrences. To satisfy these clauses, we need to assign variable 1 to true as well.

Hence, the satisfying assignment for this problem is:
- Variable 2 is True
- Variable 1 is True
- Variable 3 is False

Therefore, our final answer is:
answer: 2 1 -3
