To solve this problem, we need to find a satisfying assignment for the given CNF formula. 

The CNF formula provided in DIMACS format is:
p cnf 3 7
-2 3 -1 0
3 -1 2 0
-2 3 -1 0
-3 1 -2 0
-1 -2 3 0
3 -2 1 0
3 -1 -2 0

We can represent the variables in the formula as follows:
1: p
2: q
3: r

Now, let's analyze the CNF formula:
-2 3 -1 0 => -q r -p
3 -1 2 0 => r -p q
-2 3 -1 0 => -q r -p
-3 1 -2 0 => -r p -q
-1 -2 3 0 => -p -q r
3 -2 1 0 => r -q p
3 -1 -2 0 => r -p -q

We need to satisfy all clauses in the formula simultaneously. By inspecting the clauses, we can observe that there is a contradiction between clauses:
-3 1 -2 0 => -r p -q
3 -2 1 0 => r -q p

These clauses conflict because the first suggests that r must be false and the second suggests that r must be true. Therefore, the formula is unsatisfiable.

answer: UNSATISFIABLE
