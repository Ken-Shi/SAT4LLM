Given the DIMACS format:
p cnf 3 7
1 -3 2 0
1 -2 -3 0
-2 -3 1 0
-3 -2 1 0
-2 -3 1 0
-2 1 -3 0
-2 -3 1 0

This SAT problem has 3 variables and 7 clauses.

To solve this problem, we can use the resolution method. We need to look for a satisfying assignment that makes all the clauses true. 

Let's consider the first clause:
1 -3 2

We can see that -3 is negated. So, either 3 is false or 1 is true. Since it is an OR operation, we can ignore this clause, as it is already satisfied by other clauses.

Similarly, we can analyze the other clauses and see that they are also satisfied by other clauses. 

Hence, all the clauses are redundant and can be ignored. This means that there is no need to assign any values to the variables in order to satisfy the SAT problem.

Therefore, the SAT problem is unsatisfiable.

answer: unsatisfiable
