To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we first need to analyze the clauses given:
1. (2 3 -1): This clause can be satisfied by assigning true values to variables 2 and 3 or negating variable 1.
2. (3 -1 2): This clause can be satisfied by assigning true values to variables 3 and 2 or negating variable 1.
3. (-1 -2 3): This clause can be satisfied by negating variable 1 and assigning false values to variables 2 and 3.
4. (-3 2 -1): This clause can be satisfied by negating variable 3 and assigning true values to variables 2 and 1.
5. (1 3 2): This clause can be satisfied by assigning true values to variables 1, 3, and 2.
6. (3 -1 2): This clause can be satisfied by assigning true values to variables 3, 2, and negating variable 1.
7. (2 -1 -3): This clause can be satisfied by assigning true values to variables 2 and negating variables 1 and 3.

From clauses 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7, we can see that variable 2 must be assigned a true value, and variable 1 must be negated. Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:
answer: -1 2 -3
