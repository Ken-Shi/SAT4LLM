To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to look at each clause and see if there is a way to satisfy all of them simultaneously. 

The DIMACS format represents the SAT problem as follows:
p cnf 3 7
3 -2 1 0
1 -2 -3 0
-3 1 -2 0
1 -3 -2 0
-3 -2 1 0
2 -1 -3 0
-2 1 -3 0

The first line "p cnf 3 7" indicates that there are 3 variables and 7 clauses.

Looking at the clauses:
1. (3 -2 1) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning True to variable 3, False to variable 2, and True to variable 1.
2. (1 -2 -3) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning True to variable 1, False to variable 2, and False to variable 3.
3. (-3 1 -2) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning False to variable 3, True to variable 1, and False to variable 2.
4. (1 -3 -2) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning True to variable 1, False to variable 3, and False to variable 2.
5. (-3 -2 1) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning False to variable 3, False to variable 2, and True to variable 1.
6. (2 -1 -3) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning True to variable 2, False to variable 1, and False to variable 3.
7. (-2 1 -3) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning False to variable 2, True to variable 1, and False to variable 3.

Therefore, the solution that satisfies all the clauses is:
- Variable 1 = True
- Variable 2 = False
- Variable 3 = False

answer: 1 -2 -3
