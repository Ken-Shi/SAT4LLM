Given the DIMACS format, this problem can be interpreted as follows:
- There are 3 variables (1, 2, 3) and 7 clauses.
- The 7 clauses are:
1. (3 OR -2 OR 1)
2. (3 OR -2 OR 1)
3. (-2 OR 3 OR 1)
4. (3 OR -2 OR 1)
5. (-2 OR -3 OR 1)
6. (3 OR -2 OR -1)
7. (2 OR 3 OR 1)

To solve this SAT problem, we can try to find an assignment of values for the variables that satisfies all the clauses.

Starting with an initial assignment:
- Let's try assigning:
  - Variable 1 = True
  - Variable 2 = False
  - Variable 3 = True

Now, we can check each clause to see if the assignment satisfies all of them:
1. (3 OR -2 OR 1) = (True OR True OR True) = True
2. (3 OR -2 OR 1) = (True OR True OR True) = True
3. (-2 OR 3 OR 1) = (True OR True OR True) = True
4. (3 OR -2 OR 1) = (True OR True OR True) = True
5. (-2 OR -3 OR 1) = (True OR False OR True) = True
6. (3 OR -2 OR -1) = (True OR True OR False) = True
7. (2 OR 3 OR 1) = (False OR True OR True) = True

Since all clauses are satisfied with this assignment, the solution is:
answer: 1 -2 3
