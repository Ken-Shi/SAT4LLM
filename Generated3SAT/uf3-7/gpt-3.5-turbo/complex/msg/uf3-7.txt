Line of thoughts:
- We have 3 variables (1, 2, 3) and 7 clauses.
- Each clause is terminated with a '0'.
- Let's go through each clause:
1. (2 1 -3) => True, since 1 and 2 are both true, but -3 is false.
2. (3 2 1) => True, since all three variables are true.
3. (2 1 3) => True, since 1 and 3 are true, but 2 is false.
4. (2 1 3) => True, since 1 and 3 are true, but 2 is false.
5. (3 1 2) => True, since all three variables are true.
6. (3 -2 1) => True, since 3 and 1 are true, but -2 is false.
7. (3 2 1) => True, since all three variables are true.

Therefore, the solution is satisfiable.

answer: SATISFIABLE
