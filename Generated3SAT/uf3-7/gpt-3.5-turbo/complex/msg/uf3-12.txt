The given problem is encoded in DIMACS format as follows:
p cnf 3 7
-2 3 1 0
-2 3 1 0
-3 1 -2 0
-2 1 3 0
3 -2 1 0
1 3 2 0
1 -2 3 0

This problem has 3 variables and 7 clauses. Let's analyze each clause.

1. Clause: -2 3 1
This clause can be satisfied by assigning variable 2 as false, variable 3 as true, and variable 1 as true.

2. Clause: -2 3 1
This clause is the same as the first clause and can also be satisfied by the same assignment.

3. Clause: -3 1 -2
This clause can be satisfied by assigning variable 3 as false, variable 1 as true, and variable 2 as false.

4. Clause: -2 1 3
This clause can be satisfied by assigning variable 2 as false, variable 1 as true, and variable 3 as true.

5. Clause: 3 -2 1
This clause can be satisfied by assigning variable 3 as true, variable 2 as false, and variable 1 as true.

6. Clause: 1 3 2
This clause can be satisfied by assigning variable 1 as true, variable 3 as true, and variable 2 as true.

7. Clause: 1 -2 3
This clause can be satisfied by assigning variable 1 as true, variable 2 as false, and variable 3 as true.

Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:
answer: 1 -2 3
