To solve this SAT problem, we need to examine the given clauses in DIMACS format:
1. (3 2 1) -> (3=true, 2=true, 1=true)
2. (1 3 2) -> (1=true, 3=true, 2=true)
3. (2 3 -1) -> (2=true, 3=true, 1=false)
4. (3 2 1) -> (3=true, 2=true, 1=true)
5. (2 1 -3) -> (2=true, 1=true, 3=false)
6. (1 -3 2) -> (1=true, 3=false, 2=true)
7. (2 1 3) -> (2=true, 1=true, 3=true)

We can see that clause 3 is contradicted by clause 6, because they have opposite values for variable 1.
Thus, the only way to satisfy all clauses is to set variable 1 to false.
Then, clause 6 is satisfied by setting variable 2 to true.
Variable 3 can be set to either true or false, as both values satisfy all clauses.

Therefore, the final solution is:
answer: 1 -2 3
