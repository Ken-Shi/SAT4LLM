First, let's analyze the DIMACS format provided:
- The first line "p cnf 3 7" indicates that the SAT problem has 3 variables and 7 clauses.
- The following lines represent the 7 clauses in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), where each number corresponds to a literal. The literals are encoded as follows: positive integers represent variables and negative integers represent the negation of variables. The clauses end with a '0'.

Now, let's interpret the clauses:
1. (-3 2 1) : Either variable 2 or variable 1 must be true if variable 3 is false.
2. (2 -3 -1) : Either variable 2 must be true if variable 3 and variable 1 are false.
3. (-3 2 -1) : Either variable 2 must be true if variable 3 is false and variable 1 is true.
4. (-3 -1 2) : Either variable 2 must be true if variable 3 is false and variable 1 is false.
5. (2 -1 -3) : Either variable 2 must be true if variable 1 is false and variable 3 is true.
6. (3 2 -1) : Either variable 3 must be true if variable 2 is true and variable 1 is false.
7. (-1 -3 2) : Either variable 2 must be true if variable 1 is false and variable 3 is false.

Now, we will solve the SAT problem by finding an assignment of values to the variables that satisfies all the clauses.

answer: The SAT problem is satisfiable. One possible solution is: 
Variable 1 = False
Variable 2 = True
Variable 3 = True
