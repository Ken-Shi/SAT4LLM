First, let's decode the problem. The first line "p cnf 3 7" tells us that there are 3 variables and 7 clauses. 

The clauses are:
1. (3 OR 2 OR 1)
2. (1 OR -2 OR 3)
3. (3 OR 1 OR -2)
4. (1 OR -2 OR 3)
5. (-2 OR 1 OR 3)
6. (3 OR 1 OR -2)
7. (3 OR 1 OR -2)

Now, let's try to find a satisfying assignment:
- For clause 1: Assume 3 is True, this makes the whole clause True.
- For clause 2: Assume 1 is True, this makes the whole clause True.
- For clause 3: Assume 3 is True, this makes the whole clause True.
- For clause 4: Assume 1 is True, this makes the whole clause True.
- For clause 5: Assume -2 is True, this makes the whole clause True.
- For clause 6: Assume 3 is True, this makes the whole clause True.
- For clause 7: Assume 3 is True, this makes the whole clause True.

Therefore, the satisfying assignment is: 1=True, 2=False, 3=True.

answer: 1=False, 2=True, 3=True
