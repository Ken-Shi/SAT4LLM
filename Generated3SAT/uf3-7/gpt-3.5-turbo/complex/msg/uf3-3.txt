To solve this SAT problem, we first list out the clauses:
1. (-3 -2 1)
2. (1 2 -3)
3. (-2 1 -3)
4. (1 -3 2)
5. (-1 -2 -3)
6. (-3 1 -2)
7. (-2 1 3)

We have 3 variables and 7 clauses. Now, we can start evaluating the clauses to see if there is a satisfying assignment.

For clause 1 (-3 -2 1): None of the literals can be true at the same time, so this clause is unsatisfiable.

For clause 2 (1 2 -3): At least one literal must be true. If we set all literals to false, this clause is unsatisfied.

For clause 3 (-2 1 -3): At least one literal must be true. If we set all literals to false, this clause is unsatisfied.

For clause 4 (1 -3 2): At least one literal must be true. If we set all literals to false, this clause is unsatisfied.

For clause 5 (-1 -2 -3): At least one literal must be true. If we set all literals to false, this clause is unsatisfied.

For clause 6 (-3 1 -2): At least one literal must be true. If we set all literals to false, this clause is unsatisfied.

For clause 7 (-2 1 3): At least one literal must be true. If we set all literals to false, this clause is unsatisfied.

Since all of the clauses are unsatisfiable, this SAT problem does not have a solution.

answer: UNSATISFIABLE
