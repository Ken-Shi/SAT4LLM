To solve this SAT problem, we can start by analyzing the clauses in the DIMACS format:

1. (1 2 -3) - This means either variable 1 and 2 are true and variable 3 is false or vice versa.
2. (-3 2 1) - This means either variable 3 is false and variables 2, 1 are true or vice versa.
3. (1 3 2) - This means either variable 1, 3 are true and variable 2 is true.
4. (1 2 -3) - Same as 1.
5. (1 -2 -3) - This means variable 1 is true and either variable 2 or 3 are false.
6. (1 -2 3) - This means variable 1 is true and either variable 2 is false or variable 3 is true.
7. (-3 2 1) - Same as 2.

From these clauses, we can see that the only way to satisfy all clauses simultaneously is to assign:
- variable 1 as true
- variable 2 as false
- variable 3 as false

Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:
answer: 1 -2 -3
