To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we first need to understand the format. The first line 'p cnf 3 7' indicates that there are 3 variables and 7 clauses. The following lines represent the clauses in conjunctive normal form (CNF).

The clauses are as follows:
1. (2 OR 1 OR 3)
2. (2 OR 1 OR 3)
3. (2 OR 1 OR 3)
4. (-3 OR 1 OR 2)
5. (1 OR 3 OR 2)
6. (1 OR 2 OR 3)
7. (-2 OR 3 OR 1)

To solve this problem, we can start by trying to find a satisfying assignment for the clauses. Let's analyze the clauses:

- Clause 1, 2, and 3 require at least one of variables 1, 2, or 3 to be true. We can satisfy these clauses by setting all variables to true.
- Clause 4 requires either variable 1 or 2 to be true, which is already satisfied.
- Clause 5 requires either variable 1 or 3 to be true, which is also satisfied.
- Clause 6 requires at least one of variables 1, 2, or 3 to be true, which is already satisfied.
- Clause 7 requires either variable 3 or 1 to be true, which is also satisfied.

Therefore, the satisfying assignment for this SAT problem is:
1. Variable 1 is true
2. Variable 2 is true
3. Variable 3 is true

Therefore, the final answer is: 
answer: 1 1 1
