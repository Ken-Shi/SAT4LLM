To solve the SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will first convert the problem into a set of clauses.

The DIMACS format provided is:
p cnf 3 3
3 1 -2 0
3 1 -2 0
3 -2 -1 0

Converting to clauses:
Clause 1: (3 or 1 or -2)
Clause 2: (3 or 1 or -2)
Clause 3: (3 or -2 or -1)

Based on the clauses, we can identify the following assignments:
- For Clause 1: Either variable 3 or variable 1 or variable -2 must be true.
- For Clause 2: Either variable 3 or variable 1 or variable -2 must be true.
- For Clause 3: Either variable 3 or variable -2 or variable -1 must be true.

From the first two clauses, we can see that variable 3 is true. 
Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: 3
