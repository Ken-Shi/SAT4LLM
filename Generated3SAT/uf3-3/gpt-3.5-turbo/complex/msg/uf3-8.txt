Given the following SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format:

p cnf 3 3
-1 3 2 0
1 -2 3 0
3 2 1 0

We have 3 variables (1, 2, 3) and 3 clauses.

To solve this SAT problem, we can try to assign truth values to the variables that satisfy all the clauses. 

Let's go through the clauses:
1. (-1 OR 3 OR 2) => True if either 1 or 3 or 2 is True
2. (1 OR -2 OR 3) => True if either 1 or -2 or 3 is True
3. (3 OR 2 OR 1) => True if either 3 or 2 or 1 is True

By analyzing the clauses, we can see that all three clauses are satisfied by assigning the following truth values:
1 = True
2 = False
3 = True

Therefore, the solution to the SAT problem is:
answer: 1 -2 3
