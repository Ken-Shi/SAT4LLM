To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we first need to understand the format. The first line "p cnf 3 3" indicates that there are 3 variables and 3 clauses in the problem.

The clauses are then listed in the following lines. Each number represents a variable, with a "-" sign indicating negation. The numbers are separated by spaces and end with a 0.

From the given clauses:
1. (2 OR 1 OR -3)
2. (-3 OR 1 OR 2)
3. (2 OR 1 OR -3)

To solve this problem, we can try to find a satisfying assignment for the variables.

Let's analyze the clauses:
- The first and third clauses are the same, so we can combine them as (2 OR 1 OR -3).
- The second clause is (-3 OR 1 OR 2).

From clause 1:
- One of the literals must be true to satisfy the clause. Let's try setting variable 2 to true.

From clause 2:
- One of the literals must be true to satisfy the clause. Since variable 2 is true, this clause is already satisfied.

Therefore, a satisfying assignment for this SAT problem is:
- Variable 1 is true
- Variable 2 is true
- Variable 3 is false

answer: 1 1 -1
