To solve this SAT problem, let's first understand the DIMACS format given:

p cnf 3 3
-3 -2 1 0
-3 1 -2 0
-2 3 1 0

The first line indicates we have 3 variables and 3 clauses. Each clause is represented in the following lines.

Now, let's convert the clauses into more readable form:
Clause 1: (-3 OR -2 OR 1)
Clause 2: (-3 OR 1 OR -2)
Clause 3: (-2 OR 3 OR 1)

To solve this SAT problem, we need to find a combination of True or False values for variables 1, 2, and 3 that make all the clauses True.

Let's try to break down the clauses:
- If we make Variable 1 True, then Clauses 1 and 2 become True.
- If we make Variable 2 True, then Clauses 1 and 3 become True.
- If we make Variable 3 True, then Clauses 1 and 2 become True.

Combining all the information, we can deduce that making Variable 1 True would satisfy all the clauses.

Therefore, the solution is:
answer: 1 0 0
