To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we first need to interpret the input. 

The header "p cnf 3 3" indicates that there are 3 variables and 3 clauses in the problem. 
The clauses are:
1. 3 1 2 0
2. -1 3 2 0
3. -1 3 2 0

Now, we can try to find a satisfying assignment for the clauses. Let's go through the clauses one by one:
1. Clause 1: 3 OR 1 OR 2 = True
2. Clause 2: NOT 1 OR 3 OR 2 = True
3. Clause 3: NOT 1 OR 3 OR 2 = True

Looking at the three clauses together, we can see that a solution that satisfies all the clauses simultaneously would be:
- Variable 1 is False
- Variable 2 is True
- Variable 3 is True

Therefore, the satisfying assignment for this SAT problem is:
answer: -1 2 3
