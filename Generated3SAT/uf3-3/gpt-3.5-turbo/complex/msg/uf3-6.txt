To solve this SAT problem, we first need to analyze the DIMACS format given:

p cnf 3 3
-3 -2 1 0
-2 1 -3 0
-2 1 -3 0

The first line indicates that there are 3 variables and 3 clauses in this SAT problem. 
The clauses are:
1. Clause 1: -3 -2 1 (meaning NOT x3 OR NOT x2 OR x1)
2. Clause 2: -2 1 -3 (meaning NOT x2 OR x1 OR NOT x3)
3. Clause 3: -2 1 -3 (repeated clause)

We can simplify the clauses by removing the repeated one, giving us:
1. -3 -2 1
2. -2 1 -3

Now, let's try to find a solution by assigning values to the variables:
Let's assume x1 = True, x2 = False, and x3 = False:
1. -3 -2 1 = -False -False True = True
2. -2 1 -3 = -False True -False = True

Therefore, our assignment x1 = True, x2 = False, and x3 = False satisfies all the clauses, making the SAT problem solvable.

answer: x1=True, x2=False, x3=False.
