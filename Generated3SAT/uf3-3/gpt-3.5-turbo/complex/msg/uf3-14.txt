Given the following SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format:

p cnf 3 3
-1 3 -2 0
1 3 2 0
3 -2 1 0

We have 3 variables and 3 clauses in conjunctive normal form.

To solve this problem, we need to find values for the 3 variables (1, 2, 3) such that all 3 clauses are satisfied.

Let's analyze each clause:
1. Clause: -1 3 -2
This means that either variable 1 is false, variable 3 is true, or variable 2 is false. We can satisfy this clause by setting variable 1 to false, variable 3 to true, and variable 2 to false.

2. Clause: 1 3 2
This means that either variable 1 is true, variable 3 is true, or variable 2 is true. We can satisfy this clause by setting variable 1, 3, and 2 all to true.

3. Clause: 3 -2 1
This means that either variable 3 is true, variable 2 is false, or variable 1 is true. We have already satisfied this clause in the first two clauses.

Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:
answer: 1 1 1
