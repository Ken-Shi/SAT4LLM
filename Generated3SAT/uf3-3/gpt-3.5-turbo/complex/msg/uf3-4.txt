To solve this problem, we first need to understand the DIMACS format. In this case, the problem has 3 variables and 3 clauses. The clauses are:
1. 1 OR 3 OR NOT 2
2. NOT 1 OR 3 OR NOT 2
3. 2 OR NOT 1 OR 3

Now let's analyze each clause:
1. For the first clause to be true, at least one of the literals must be true. If we set variables 1 and 3 to true and variable 2 to false, the clause becomes true.
2. For the second clause to be true, at least one of the literals must be true. If we set variables 1 and 3 to true and variable 2 to false, the clause becomes true.
3. For the third clause to be true, at least one of the literals must be true. If we set variables 1 and 3 to true and variable 2 to false, the clause becomes true.

Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is: 
answer: 1 1 -1
