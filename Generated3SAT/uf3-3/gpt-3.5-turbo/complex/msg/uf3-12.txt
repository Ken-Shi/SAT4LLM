To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, let's first understand the input:
- There are 3 variables and 3 clauses.
- The clauses are:
  1. (2 OR NOT 3 OR 1)
  2. (1 OR NOT 3 OR 2)
  3. (NOT 2 OR NOT 3 OR 1)

Now, let's try to find a satisfying assignment that makes all clauses true. We can start with an initial assignment and then iterate through the clauses to see if they are satisfied or not.

Let's start with the initial assignment where all variables are set to False:
- Assignments: 1=False, 2=False, 3=False

Now, let's check each clause to see if they are satisfied or not:
1. (2 OR NOT 3 OR 1) = (False OR True OR False) = True (Satisfied)
2. (1 OR NOT 3 OR 2) = (False OR True OR False) = True (Satisfied)
3. (NOT 2 OR NOT 3 OR 1) = (True OR True OR False) = True (Satisfied)

Since all clauses are satisfied with the initial assignment, the problem is satisfiable.

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: 1 0 0
