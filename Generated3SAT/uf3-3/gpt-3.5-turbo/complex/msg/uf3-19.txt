To solve this SAT problem, we can translate it into a system of logical equations. 

The DIMACS format specifies that there are 3 variables and 3 clauses in the formula. The clauses are as follows:

1. (x1 OR x3 OR NOT x2)
2. (x1 OR NOT x2 OR NOT x3)
3. (NOT x2 OR x1 OR NOT x3)

To solve this problem, we can set up a truth table for these logical equations and try to find a combination of true and false values that satisfies all the clauses. 

Upon analyzing the logical equations, we can see that the first and second clauses can be simultaneously satisfied by setting x1 = True, x2 = False, and x3 = True. 

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: x1=True, x2=False, x3=True
