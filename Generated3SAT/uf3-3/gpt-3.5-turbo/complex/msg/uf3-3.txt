To solve this problem, we need to analyze the DIMACS format provided:

The first line "p cnf 3 3" indicates that there are 3 variables and 3 clauses in the problem.

The three clauses are as follows:
1. 3 1 2 0, which can be translated to (x3 OR x1 OR x2)
2. -3 -1 2 0, which can be translated to (NOT x3 OR NOT x1 OR x2)
3. -1 -3 2 0, which can be translated to (NOT x1 OR NOT x3 OR x2)

Now, we need to determine a solution that satisfies all three clauses. Let's analyze each clause:
- For clause 1, we need at least one of x3, x1, or x2 to be true.
- For clause 2, we cannot have x3 AND x1 to be true, but we can have x2 as true.
- For clause 3, we cannot have x1 AND x3 to be true, but we can have x2 as true.

Now, let's try to find a solution that satisfies all three clauses:
- If we assign x3 = True, x1 = False, x2 = True, all three clauses are satisfied.
Therefore, the solution is: x3 = True, x1 = False, x2 = True.

answer: x3 = True, x1 = False, x2 = True
