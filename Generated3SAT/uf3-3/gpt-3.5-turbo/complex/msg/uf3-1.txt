To solve this problem, we will convert the DIMACS format clauses into logical expressions and then try to satisfy all the conditions.

The DIMACS format:
p cnf 3 3
-1 2 -3 0
-3 2 1 0
2 -3 1 0

Converting into logical expressions:
1. (!p v q v !r)
2. (!r v q v p)
3. (q v !r v p)

For a clause to be true, at least one literal must be true. Now, we will try to satisfy all the clauses:

Let's start with the first clause:
(!p v q v !r)
Assume p is false, q is true, and r is false. This satisfies the first clause.

Now, moving on to the second clause:
(!r v q v p)
Using the values from the first clause, this clause is also satisfied.

Finally, looking at the third clause:
(q v !r v p)
With the same values, the third clause is also satisfied.

Therefore, the solution that satisfies all the clauses is:
p = False
q = True
r = False

answer: p = False, q = True, r = False
