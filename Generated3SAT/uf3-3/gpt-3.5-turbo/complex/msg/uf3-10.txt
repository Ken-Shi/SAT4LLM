DIMACS format is a way of representing SAT (Boolean Satisfiability) problems. In this format, the first line contains information about the problem such as the number of variables and clauses. Each subsequent line represents a clause in the problem.

In this particular problem, we have 3 variables and 3 clauses. The clauses are as follows:
1. (1 OR -2 OR 3)
2. (3 OR -2 OR -1)
3. (1 OR 2 OR 3)

To solve this problem, we can try to assign truth values to the variables in such a way that all clauses are satisfied. Let's try to do it below:

For the first clause, either variable 1 must be true, or variable 3 must be true. Let's set variable 1 to true.
For the second clause, variable 3 must be true, and variables 1 and 2 must be false. This leads to a contradiction since we already set variable 1 to true. So this clause cannot be satisfied.
For the third clause, either variable 1 or variable 2 must be true. We have already set variable 1 to true, so let's set variable 2 to true.

Therefore, our final assignment of truth values is:
1: true
2: true
3: true

answer: 1 1 1
