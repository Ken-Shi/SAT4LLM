To solve this SAT problem, we can first break down the DIMACS format:

p cnf 3 3
-2 3 -1 0
-1 -2 -3 0
3 2 -1 0

The first line indicates that there are 3 variables and 3 clauses in the problem.

The clauses are:
1. (-2 OR 3 OR -1)
2. (-1 OR -2 OR -3)
3. (3 OR 2 OR -1)

Now, let's consider each clause one by one:

Clause 1: (-2 OR 3 OR -1)
We see that if we assign 2 to False, 3 to True, and 1 to False, then this clause will evaluate to True. This assignment satisfies the first clause.

Clause 2: (-1 OR -2 OR -3)
If we assign 1 to False, 2 to False, and 3 to True, then this clause will also evaluate to True. Therefore, this assignment satisfies the second clause.

Clause 3: (3 OR 2 OR -1)
Lastly, if we assign 3 to True, 2 to False, and 1 to False, then this clause will evaluate to True. Thus, this assignment satisfies the third clause.

Therefore, the solution to the SAT problem is:
answer: 0 1 0
