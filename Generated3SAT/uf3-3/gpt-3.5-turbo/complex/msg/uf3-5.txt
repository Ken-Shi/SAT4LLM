To solve this problem, we need to find a satisfying assignment for the given CNF formula. In this case, the CNF formula has 3 variables (labeled 1, 2, and 3) and 3 clauses.

The CNF formula in DIMACS format is:
p cnf 3 3
3 -1 2 0
2 -1 -3 0
2 -1 3 0

Let's break down the clauses:
1. (3 or not 1 or 2)
2. (2 or not 1 or not 3)
3. (2 or not 1 or 3)

To find a satisfying assignment, we can try all possible combinations of truth values for the 3 variables:
- If variable 1 is true, then variable 2 must be true to satisfy the first and third clauses, and variable 3 must be false to satisfy the first and third clauses.
- If variable 1 is false, then variable 2 must be true and variable 3 must be false to satisfy the second clause.

Therefore, a possible solution is:
answer: 1 -2 -3
