To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use the following CNF clauses:
- Clause 1: (-1 v -2 v 3)
- Clause 2: (1 v -2 v -3)
- Clause 3: (3 v 2 v 1)

Now, we can try to find a solution by assigning either TRUE or FALSE to each variable in the clauses and checking if the resulting values satisfy all the clauses. 

Let's proceed with the following assignment:
- Variable 1: TRUE
- Variable 2: FALSE
- Variable 3: TRUE

Now, let's substitute these values into our clauses:
- Clause 1: (-1 v -2 v 3) = (FALSE v TRUE v TRUE) = TRUE
- Clause 2: (1 v -2 v -3) = (TRUE v TRUE v FALSE) = TRUE
- Clause 3: (3 v 2 v 1) = (TRUE v FALSE v TRUE) = TRUE

Since all clauses evaluate to TRUE, the assignment (1, FALSE, 1) satisfies the SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format.

answer: Variable 1 = TRUE, Variable 2 = FALSE, Variable 3 = TRUE
