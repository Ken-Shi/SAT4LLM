(2 OR NOT 3 OR 1)\n  2. (1 OR NOT 3 OR 2)\n  3. (NOT 2 OR NOT 3 OR 1)\n\nNow, let's try to find a satisfying assignment that makes all clauses true. We can start with an initial assignment and then iterate through the clauses to see if they are satisfied or not.\n\nLet's start with the initial assignment where all variables are set to False:\n- Assignments: 1=False, 2=False, 3=False\n\nNow, let's check each clause to see if they are satisfied or not:\n1. (2 OR NOT 3 OR 1) = (False OR True OR False) = True (Satisfied)\n2. (1 OR NOT 3 OR 2) = (False OR True OR False) = True (Satisfied)\n3. (NOT 2 OR NOT 3 OR 1) = (True OR True OR False) = True (Satisfied)\n\nSince all clauses are satisfied with the initial assignment, the problem is satisfiable.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nanswer: 1 0 0"
