Clause: -1 3 -2\nThis means that either variable 1 is false, variable 3 is true, or variable 2 is false. We can satisfy this clause by setting variable 1 to false, variable 3 to true, and variable 2 to false.\n\n2. Clause: 1 3 2\nThis means that either variable 1 is true, variable 3 is true, or variable 2 is true. We can satisfy this clause by setting variable 1, 3, and 2 all to true.\n\n3. Clause: 3 -2 1\nThis means that either variable 3 is true, variable 2 is false, or variable 1 is true. We have already satisfied this clause in the first two clauses.\n\nTherefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:\nanswer: 1 1 1"
