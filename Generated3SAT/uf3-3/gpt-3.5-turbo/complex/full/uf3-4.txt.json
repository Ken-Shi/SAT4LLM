NOT 1 OR 3 OR NOT 2\n3. 2 OR NOT 1 OR 3\n\nNow let's analyze each clause:\n1. For the first clause to be true, at least one of the literals must be true. If we set variables 1 and 3 to true and variable 2 to false, the clause becomes true.\n2. For the second clause to be true, at least one of the literals must be true. If we set variables 1 and 3 to true and variable 2 to false, the clause becomes true.\n3. For the third clause to be true, at least one of the literals must be true. If we set variables 1 and 3 to true and variable 2 to false, the clause becomes true.\n\nTherefore, the solution to this SAT problem is: \nanswer: 1 1 -1"
