Start with an empty assignment for the variables: {}.\n2. Evaluate each clause one by one:\n   a. In the first clause (3 2 1):\n      - Since all the variables (1, 2, 3) are positive, we can assign True to all of them: {1: True, 2: True, 3: True}.\n      - This makes the clause True.\n   b. In the second clause (-2 3 1):\n      - Since variable 2 is negated, we assign False to it: {1: True, 2: False}.\n      - Evaluating the clause, we have {1: True, 2: False, 3: True}.\n      - This makes the clause True.\n   c. In the third clause (3 -2 -1):\n      - Since variable 1 is negated, we assign False to it: {1: False, 2: False}.\n      - Evaluating the clause, we have {1: False, 2: False, 3: True}.\n      - This makes the clause True.\n\nTherefore, the assignment {1: False, 2: False, 3: True} satisfies all the clauses, and hence the SAT problem is satisfiable.\n\nanswer: 1 0 0"
