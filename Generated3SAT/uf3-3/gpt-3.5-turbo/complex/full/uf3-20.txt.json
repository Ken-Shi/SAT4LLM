(-2 OR 3 OR -1)\n2. (-1 OR -2 OR -3)\n3. (3 OR 2 OR -1)\n\nNow, let's consider each clause one by one:\n\nClause 1: (-2 OR 3 OR -1)\nWe see that if we assign 2 to False, 3 to True, and 1 to False, then this clause will evaluate to True. This assignment satisfies the first clause.\n\nClause 2: (-1 OR -2 OR -3)\nIf we assign 1 to False, 2 to False, and 3 to True, then this clause will also evaluate to True. Therefore, this assignment satisfies the second clause.\n\nClause 3: (3 OR 2 OR -1)\nLastly, if we assign 3 to True, 2 to False, and 1 to False, then this clause will evaluate to True. Thus, this assignment satisfies the third clause.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the SAT problem is:\nanswer: 0 1 0"
