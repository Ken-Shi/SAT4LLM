Clause 1: -1 -2 -3\nThis clause means that at least one of the variables 1, 2, or 3 must be false.\n\n2. Clause 2: -3 -2 1\nThis clause means that either variable 1 must be true or both variables 2 and 3 must be false.\n\n3. Clause 3: -3 -1 -2\nThis clause means that either variable 1 must be false or both variables 2 and 3 must be false.\n\nFrom analyzing the clauses, we can see that there is a contradiction between clauses 2 and 3. Clause 2 requires that variable 1 is true, while clause 3 requires that variable 1 is false. This contradiction proves that the given SAT problem is unsatisfiable.\n\nanswer: unsatisfiable"
