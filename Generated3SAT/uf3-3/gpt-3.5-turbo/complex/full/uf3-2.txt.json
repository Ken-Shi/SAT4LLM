Each clause is represented in the following lines.\n\nNow, let's convert the clauses into more readable form:\nClause 1: (-3 OR -2 OR 1)\nClause 2: (-3 OR 1 OR -2)\nClause 3: (-2 OR 3 OR 1)\n\nTo solve this SAT problem, we need to find a combination of True or False values for variables 1, 2, and 3 that make all the clauses True.\n\nLet's try to break down the clauses:\n- If we make Variable 1 True, then Clauses 1 and 2 become True.\n- If we make Variable 2 True, then Clauses 1 and 3 become True.\n- If we make Variable 3 True, then Clauses 1 and 2 become True.\n\nCombining all the information, we can deduce that making Variable 1 True would satisfy all the clauses.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\nanswer: 1 0 0"
