Let's go through the clauses one by one:\n1. Clause 1: 3 OR 1 OR 2 = True\n2. Clause 2: NOT 1 OR 3 OR 2 = True\n3. Clause 3: NOT 1 OR 3 OR 2 = True\n\nLooking at the three clauses together, we can see that a solution that satisfies all the clauses simultaneously would be:\n- Variable 1 is False\n- Variable 2 is True\n- Variable 3 is True\n\nTherefore, the satisfying assignment for this SAT problem is:\nanswer: -1 2 3"
