(!p v q v !r)\n2. (!r v q v p)\n3. (q v !r v p)\n\nFor a clause to be true, at least one literal must be true. Now, we will try to satisfy all the clauses:\n\nLet's start with the first clause:\n(!p v q v !r)\nAssume p is false, q is true, and r is false. This satisfies the first clause.\n\nNow, moving on to the second clause:\n(!r v q v p)\nUsing the values from the first clause, this clause is also satisfied.\n\nFinally, looking at the third clause:\n(q v !r v p)\nWith the same values, the third clause is also satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the solution that satisfies all the clauses is:\np = False\nq = True\nr = False\n\nanswer: p = False, q = True, r = False"
