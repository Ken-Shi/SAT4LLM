The problem provided is in a format designed to be easily interpreted by a computer program. It uses Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and is part of the DIMACS format often used for specifying instances of the SAT problem.

A few things to understand before we solve the problem:

CNF is the conjunction(dependent) of one or more clauses, where a clause is a disjunction(independent) of literals.

A literal is either a variable, this case 1, 2 and 3 or the negation of a variable -1, -2 or -3.

From the given problem,

p cnf 3 3 => **3 -** the total number of variables, **3 -** the total number of clauses.

Now, moving on to the clauses:

3 1 2 0 - This means 3 V 1 V 2 (where V denotes 'or'). It implies at least one of the literals (3,1,2) must be true or 1.

-3 -1 2 0 - This means -3 V -1 V 2 OR NOT 3 OR NOT 1 OR 2. It implies not 3 and not 1 OR 2 must be true or 1.

-1 -3 2 0 - This means -1 V -3 V 2 OR NOT 1 OR NOT 3 OR 2. It implies not 1 and not 3 OR 2 must be true or 1.

So now, guess and confirm a solution, for example: 1=0, 2=1 and 3=0.

1. 1st clause: 3 or 1 or 2 => 0 or 0 or 1= 1
2. 2nd clause: not 3 or not 1 or 2 => 1 or 1 or 1= 1
3. 3rd clause: not 1 or not 3 or 2 => 1 or 1 or 1= 1

All clauses evaluate to 1, so our guess is a solution.

Answer: 1=0, 2=1, 3=0.
