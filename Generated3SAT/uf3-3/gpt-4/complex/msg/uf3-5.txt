As we interpret the problem, the letter 'p' stands for problem, 'cnf' stands for Conjunctive Normal Form, 3 stands for the number of variables (x1, x2, x3) and 3 stands for the number of clauses.

The rest of the lines represent the clauses.

3 -1 2 0 -> means (x3 OR NOTx1 OR x2)
2 -1 -3 0 -> means (x2 OR NOTx1 OR NOTx3)
2 -1 3 0 -> means (x2 OR NOTx1 OR x3)

We can use the Model Enumeration Method to solve these clauses.

Creating a table of all possible boolean values for x1, x2, x3, there are 2^3 = 8 possibilities. 

Each line of the table is a model and we check if these satisfy the formula:

x1, x2, x3 = 

F, F, F -> None of the clauses are satisfied, therefore this solution is invalid.
F, F, T -> The first clause is satisfied, but the other two are not, therefore this solution is invalid.
F, T, F -> The first and second clause are satisfied, but the third is not, therefore this solution is invalid.
F, T, T -> All clauses are satisfied, therefore this is a valid solution.
T, F, F -> None of the clauses are satisfied, therefore this solution is invalid.
T, F, T -> None of the clauses are satisfied, therefore this solution is invalid.
T, T, F -> None of the clauses are satisfied, therefore this solution is invalid.
T, T, T -> The first clause is satisfied, but the other two are not, therefore this solution is invalid.

So there is only one solution that satisfies all the requirement.

answer: x1=False, x2=True, x3=True.
