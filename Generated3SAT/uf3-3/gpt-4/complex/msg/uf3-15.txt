The problem is a CNF-SAT (Conjunctive Normal Form Satisfiability) problem with 3 variables and 3 clauses. CNF is a conjunction of one or more clauses, where a clause is a disjunction of literals. The goal of solving this problem is finding a set of Boolean assignments to the variables that satisfies all the clauses.

Let's convert the DIMACS format into more human-readable form:
- 1st clause: NOT x1 OR NOT x2 OR NOT x3
- 2nd clause: NOT x3 OR NOT x2 OR x1
- 3rd clause: NOT x3 OR NOT x1 OR NOT x2 

According to these clauses, we can see that for all clauses to be true, x3 must be false. This is because x3 is always associated with a NOT in all clauses. So let's assign x3 = false.

With x3 = false:
- 1st clause: NOT x1 OR NOT x2 (still could be either true or false)
- 2nd clause: NOT x2 OR x1 (again, either could be true or false)
- 3rd clause: NOT x1 OR NOT x2 (still could be either true or false)

For all these clauses to be true, either x1 or x2 also has to be false. Because x1 and x2 appear on all remaining clauses, we can freely assign x1 = true and x2 = false, or vice versa.

Possible solutions could be x1 = true, x2 = false, x3 = false or x1 = false, x2 = true, x3 = false. To confirm this solution, you can plug these values back into the original clauses and check if all of them are true.

So, the answer could be:

Answer: x1 = true, x2 = false, x3 = false OR x1 = false, x2 = true, x3 = false. In binary form, this would be either 101 or 011 respectively.
