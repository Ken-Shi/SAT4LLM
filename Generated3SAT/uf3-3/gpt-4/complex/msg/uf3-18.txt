Before starting to solve the problem, let me first explain what the DIMACS format is to establish the problem's context.

The DIMACS file format is a standard for specifying Boolean SATisfiability (SAT) problems. In brief, every row in the file represents a disjunction of literals (a clause), and the entire file represents the conjunction of these clauses.

In our case,

* "p cnf 3 3" gives us some metadata about the problem. The "p cnf" is just a prefix. The number 3 tells us there are three variables, and the second 3 says there is a total of three clauses.
* The next three lines ("-3 2 1 0", "2 1 3 0", "1 2 3 0") represent three clauses. Every line will have a sequence of nonzero integers out of {-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3}, ending with zero. Each integer's absolute value corresponds to a variable (so 1 corresponds to variable 1, for instance), and the sign of the integer says whether the variable is negated or not in the clause. For instance, -3 corresponds to NOT variable 3. The zero at the end just signifies the end of the clause.

Thus, the given SAT problem can be translated to a more conventional syntax as follows:

(-x3 OR x2 OR x1) AND (x2 OR x1 OR x3) AND (x1 OR x2 OR x3)

We need to find the truth value assignments that make the entire conjunction of clauses true. As the clauses are disjunctions (OR operations), if we can find any literal in a clause that's true, the entire clause is true.

Now, let's find the solution:

1. Looking at the first clause (-x3 OR x2 OR x1), we can see that if we assign x1 and x2 to be true and x3 to be false, this clause will be evaluated to true (since the truth of any literal makes the entire OR clause true).
2. For the second clause (x2 OR x1 OR x3), since x1 and x2 are already true from the previous clause, this clause is also true.
3. For the third clause (x1 OR x2 OR x3), the clause is also evaluated as true, based on our previous assignments (since x1 and x2 are true).

So, x1 = true, x2 = true, x3 = false is a solution that satisfies all clauses.

Answer: [1,-2,3] (In DIMACS format, true is often represented by the variable itself and false by the negative variable.)
