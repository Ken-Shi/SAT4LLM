This task involves solving a problem given in DIMACS format for the SAT problem. A SAT problem is a Boolean problem where we want to determine if there exists a satisfying assignment of true/false variables to all expressions such that all clauses are true.

The problem is given in the following format:

p cnf 3 3: This tells us that there are three variables and three clauses in the problem.

Below this, each clause is listed line by line.

Our goal is to find an assignment of three variables (as mentioned in the DIMACS representation - cnf 3 3) that satisfies every clause. In each clause, a variable with a negative sign represents NOT operation.

Here's how the clauses look:

    Clause 1: 2 OR NOT 3 OR 1
    Clause 2: 1 OR NOT 3 OR 2
    Clause 3: NOT 2 OR NOT 3 OR 1

Our goal is to find assignments for the variables 1, 2, and 3 that make each clause true. The beauty of an OR operation is that as long as we have a single TRUE in the clause, the whole clause becomes TRUE. 

For Clause 1 to be true, we have either variable 2, or NOT variable 3, or variable 1 to be true. But looking at all of the clauses, it seems like variables 1 and 2 are always positive, so let's set both 1 and 2 to TRUE. This will instantly satisfy all of our clauses.

We can assign variable 3 any value since it doesn't influence the satisfiability of the clauses in this case (it always appears as NOT 3).

Hence, we assign 1 = TRUE, 2 = TRUE, and 3 = FALSE/TRUE.

Answer: 1=TRUE, 2=TRUE, 3=FALSE or 3=TRUE
