The input is a 3-SAT problem with three clauses and three variables. 

The DIMACS CNF format is interpreted as follows:

p cnf 3 3 => Problem is in conjunctive normal form (cnf) with 3 variables and 3 clauses

-1 3 -2 0 => 1st clause: NOT variable 1 OR variable 3 OR NOT variable 2

1 3 2 0 => 2nd clause: variable 1 OR variable 3 OR variable 2

3 -2 1 0 => 3rd clause: variable 3 OR NOT variable 2 OR variable 1

Staring at the 3 clauses, we can conclude that:

- In the first and second clause, variable 3 appears as a positive literal. Therefore, we can satisfy both clauses by setting variable 3 to TRUE. 

- We can make the third clause true as well by setting variable 1 to TRUE.

- For variable 2, we can choose either TRUE or FALSE because it does not matter for the satisfaction of all clauses based on variables 1 and 3.

So, solution can be constructed by considering variable 3 = TRUE, variable 1 = TRUE, and variable 2 can be either TRUE or FALSE.

Answer: Variable 1 = TRUE, Variable 2 = TRUE/FALSE, Variable 3 = TRUE
