The SAT Problem provided is in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) where each clause is presented in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF). DIMACS format is a standard for expressing these problems where:

-3 -2 1 0 means (not x3 or not x2 or x1)

-2 1 -3 0 means (not x2 or x1 or not x3)

Since we have each clause twice, it's sufficient to analyze just 2 unique clauses.

Firstly, we can see that by simply setting x1 to true (1) both clauses will be satisfied because logical OR operation will have a true clause as result if at least one variable is true.

Additionally, simply by inverting x2 and x3 to satisfy the negations in clause doesn't work as it would conflict with the positive instance of x3 in the first clause.

This leads us to conclude, the solution for this SAT Problem is x1 = 1, with x2 and x3 not affecting the result as long as x1 = 1. 

When we say a variable or expression not affecting the result, it means the variable can take either of the values 1 or 0 and it will have no effect on the overall satisfaction or dissatisfaction of the clauses.

Answer: x1=1, x2= don't care, x3= don't care.
