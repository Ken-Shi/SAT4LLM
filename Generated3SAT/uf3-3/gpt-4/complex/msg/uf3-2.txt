To solve this SAT problem, let's first understand the DIMACS format. Each line represents a clause. The sign + stands for a positive literal and the sign - stands for a negative literal in a clause. 0 at the end of line signals the end of a clause. Therefore, the clauses given are: 

- (~3 v ~2 v 1)
- (~3 v 1 v ~2)
- (~2 v 3 v 1)

Here 'v' is the logical OR operator, while ~ represents NOT.

Let's try to find a combination of variables that are true for all clauses:

First clause: To satisfy it we could set 1 = true, since it doesn't matter what value the other literals have.

Given the second clause: (~3 v 1 v ~2), we find that the clause is already true, because 1 = true. 

Looking now at the third clause: (~2 v 3 v 1), again, as 1 = true, the clause is also true, regardless the value of the other literals.

So far one possible solution is x1 = true, x2 and x3 can be either true or false.  

But actually if we analyze the problem also from a symbolic logic perspective, we can notice something interesting, out of the 3 clauses one variable is always positive while the other 2 are negative, this implies at least one must hold.

Hence, we can fit multiple combinations to fulfill this condition - x1 = true, x2 = true and x3 =false or x1 =true, x2 = false and x3 = true or x1 = true, x2 = false and x3 = false.

Answer: The problem has multiple solutions, one of them being x1 = true, x2 = true, x3 = false. Others are: x1 =true, x2 = false, x3 = true; or x1 = true, x2 = false, x3 = false.
