To solve the given problem, we need to use a method known as the SAT-solver that helps us to find a solution for the Boolean satisfiability problem. Here, each clause has a list of numbers and zero at the end. Each number corresponds to a variable and its sign indicates the kind of literal. 

In this case, we have 3 clauses:

1. The first clause (3 2 1 0) means that at least one of the variables x3, x2, x1 is True.
2. The second clause (-2 3 1 0) means that at least one of the variables ?x2, x3, x1 is True.
3. The third clause (3 -2 -1 0) means that at least one of the variables x3, ?x2, ?x1 is True.

Now, for each clause, we have to select a literal that satisfies that clause. 

- For the first clause, we can select x1 as True.
- For the second clause, we can select x3 as True (x1 is already selected as True).
- For the third clause, x3 is already made True, so this clause is satisfied.

By this way, we have: x1 = True, x2 = False, x3 = True (as ?x2 = True, so x2 = False)

Hence, the solution becomes {x1=True, x2=False, x3=True}

Answer: {x1=True, x2=False, x3=True}
