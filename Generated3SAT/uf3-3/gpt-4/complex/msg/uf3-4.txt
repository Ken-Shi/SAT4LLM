DIMACS is a format for encoding Boolean satisfiability problems (SAT) in conjunctive normal form (CNF). A problem encoded in this format is a conjunction (AND) of several clauses, where each clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals, which are variables or their negations.

The SAT problem given here is:
p cnf 3 3
1 3 -2 0
-1 3 -2 0
2 -1 3 0

First, let's break this down. There are three variables represented by 1, 2 and 3. The three clauses (separated by the zeros) could be written as follows in logical expressions:

(1 OR 3 OR NOT 2)
(NOT 1 OR 3 OR NOT 2)
(2 OR NOT 1 OR 3)

The goal is to find an assignment to variables 1, 2 and 3 such that all three expressions become true (i.e., that can satisfy all the clauses).

One way to tackle this problem is to brute force all the possibilities for the 3 variables as they can be either true or false, but in computer programming this is often done using a technique called "backtracking".

An easy way to solve it manually is to pick a starting guess and then iteratively try to satisfy all clauses with a set of assumptions. Starting with 1=True, 2=False, and 3=True, we see that all clauses are True. So we have:

(1=True OR 3=True OR NOT 2=False) = True
(NOT 1=False OR 3=True OR NOT 2=False) = True
(2=False OR NOT 1=False OR 3=True) = True

It holds for all three clauses, so the assignment is a solution to the problem.

Answer: { 1=True, 2=False, 3=True }
