SAT, or Satisfiability, is a problem in computer science that deals with determining if there?s a set of variable assignments that if substituted into a boolean formula, makes the formula true. In other words, given a formula with multiple variables, the challenge is to figure out the values the variables should take for the formula to become true. SAT was the first problem to be proven ?NP-complete?.

This particular SAT problem is represented in a standardized format called DIMACS. As per this format, the first line of the problem reads "p cnf 3 3" which means that this is a problem in boolean variables with 3 variables and 3 clauses. The next three rows indicate the clauses of the problem. 

The variables are denoted as 1, 2 and 3. If the variables are represented with a minus sign (like -2), it means 'not of that variable'. Each clause is a disjunction (a logical OR) of literals, and the total formula is a conjunction (logical AND) of all clauses. Therefore, in order for the formula to be true, each and every clause has to be true.

Let's walk through the clauses individually.
1. The first clause is 1 -2 3, which means (1 OR NOT 2 OR 3).
2. The second clause is 3 -2 -1, which means (3 OR NOT 2 OR NOT 1).
3. The third clause is 1 2 3, which means (1 OR 2 OR 3).

From the first clause we derive that we can set the variable 1 to true. As 1 is true, this makes 3rd clause also true. From the 2nd clause, since NOT 1 is false now, we must set 3 to true; however, 2 must be set false since -2 is present in both 1st and 2nd clause. Thus, the solution appears to be 1 = TRUE, 2 = FALSE, 3 = TRUE.

Answer: 1 = TRUE, 2 = FALSE, 3 = TRUE.
