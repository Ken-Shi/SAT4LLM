The problem is encoded in DIMACS CNF format. CNF stands for "Conjunctive Normal Form". This is a standard format used for representing Boolean logic expressions. Here, the problem is a Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem which means we're looking for a set of assignments to the variables that makes the entire expression true.

The first line 'p cnf 3 3' specifies this is a cnf format problem with 3 variables and 3 clauses. The following 3 lines each represent a clause. For each clause, a positive integer denotes the positive literal of a variable (i.e. the variable itself), a negative integer denotes the negative literal of a variable (i.e. the negation of variable), and '0' is the end-of-clause marker.

Let's break down each clause:
1. The first clause (2 1 -3 0) specifies that either variable 2 or variable 1 must be true, and variable 3 must *not* be true.
2. The second clause (-3 1 2 0) specifies that either variable 3 is false, or variable 1 is true, or variable 2 is true.
3. The third clause (2 1 -3 0) is identical to the first and carries the same implications.

Next, let's try assigning values to the variables to make these clauses true:

- For the first clause to be true, let's set variable 1 to True. We also have to set variable 3 to False to satisfy the -3 condition.
- Moving to the second clause, with variable 1 set to True and variable 3 set to False, this clause is already satisfied regardless of the value of variable 2.
- For the third clause, there's no further action needed as it's identical to the first clause.

Therefore, the entire expression becomes true when variable 1 is True, variable 3 is False. Variable 2 can be either True or False.

So the solution to the problem is:

Answer: 1=True, 2=True/False, 3=False

(Note that 2 can be either True or False because it doesn't affect the overall truth of the statement.)
