DIMACS format is a particular way to encode the variables and clauses that constitute an assignment problem in Boolean logic. A DIMACS file starts with a line ?p cnf m n?, where ?m? is the number of variables and ?n? is the number of clauses in the formula.

We can start to solve this by understanding the given clauses in the problem are:

-2 3 -1 0 : we can interpret it as NOT variable 2 OR variable 3 OR NOT variable 1.

-1 -2 -3 0 : we can interpret it as NOT variable 1 OR NOT variable 2 OR NOT variable 3.

3 2 -1 0 : we can interpret it as variable 3 OR variable 2 OR NOT variable 1.

We solve step by step:

1. First look for a pure literal. That is a variable that is always positive or always negative in all clauses of the formula. There is no pure literal in this problem. If there was, we would set it to true (if pure positive) or false (if pure negative).

2. Second, look for a unit clause. That is a clause with only one literal. There is no unit clause in this problem. If there was, we would set it to true (if positive) or false (if negative).

3. Because we have no pure literals or unit clauses, we need to make a guess. A common heuristic is to guess true for the literal that occurs the most, considering its sign, and guess false for the literal that occurs the least, considering its sign.
   
  - Variable1: It appears two times as NOT variable 1 and one time as variable 1.
  - Variable2: It appears one time as variable 2 and two times as NOT variable 2.
      
Given this, we would start by guessing true for variable 1, as NOT variable 1 is the most common literal. If that doesn't lead to a solution, we can backtrack and try the opposite guess.

Let's say that variable 1 = true:

- The first clause becomes FALSE OR variable 3. For the entire formula to be true, variable 3 must be TRUE.
- So, the second clause will become FALSE OR FALSE OR NOT variable 3.
- Rewriting the second clause considering variable 3 is TRUE: FALSE OR FALSE OR FALSE. This clause cannot be TRUE so variable 1 can't take value TRUE.

Let's try now variable 1 = FALSE:

- The first clause becomes NOT variable 2 OR variable 3. For this to be true, either variable 2 must be FALSE, or variable 3 must be TRUE.
- For the second clause to be TRUE, at least one of variable 2 or variable 3 must be FALSE.
- Therefore, variable 3 can't be TRUE. So, variable 3 = FALSE.
- Now, variable 2 also must be FALSE for the first clause to be TRUE.
  
So, we found a solution when variable 1 = FALSE, variable 2 = FALSE, and variable 3 = FALSE.

Answer: Variable 1 = FALSE, Variable 2 = FALSE, Variable 3 = FALSE
