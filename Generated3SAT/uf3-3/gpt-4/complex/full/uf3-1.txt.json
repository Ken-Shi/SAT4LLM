The number after the `p cnf` is the number of variables (3) and the number of clauses (3) respectively. Next, the list of clauses is given.\n\nLet's understand these clauses:\n\nThe clause `-1 2 -3 0` represents `(NOT 1) OR 2 OR (NOT 3)`.\nThe clause `-3 2 1 0` represents `(NOT 3) OR 2 OR 1`.\nThe clause `2 -3 1 0` represents `2 OR 1 OR (NOT 3)`.\n\nWe are asked to find a solution such that all clauses evaluate to true.\n\nLet's look at second and third clauses, these clauses could be satisfied by setting 1 to True (represented as 1) and 2 to True (represented as 1), regardless of the value of 3.\n\nFor first clause, to make it true, you can simply set 3 to False (represented as -3).\n\nUpon this, the three clauses become:\n\n1st clause: `(NOT 1) OR 2 OR (NOT 3)` = `(NOT True) OR True OR (NOT False)` = `False OR True OR True` which equals `True`.\n2nd clause: `(NOT 3) OR 2 OR 1` = `(NOT False) OR True OR True` = `True OR True OR True` which equals `True`.\n3rd clause: `2 OR 1 OR (NOT 3)` = `True OR True OR (NOT False)` = `True OR True OR True` which equals `True`.\n\nAs such, this solution where variable 1 and 2 are True, and variable 3 is False makes all the clauses True.\n\nAnswer: {1, 2, -3}"
