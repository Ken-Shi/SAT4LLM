'p' means this line indicates problem data. 'cnf' means that the problem is in conjunctive normal form, a specific format for expressing boolean logic. '3' after 'cnf' tells us there are three variables that we know of (let's refer to them as x1, x2, x3). The next '3' tells us that there are three clauses we're working with.\n\n2. '3 1 2 0', '-1 3 2 0', '-1 3 2 0'. - These lines are the individual clauses. Each clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals and the '0' at the end of each line indicates end of clause. A positive integer represents the index of a boolean variable, and a negative integer represents the negation of a boolean variable. \n\nWith this information, we can construct the following logical clauses:\n\n- x3 v x1 v x2\n- -x1 v x3 v x2\n- -x1 v x3 v x2\n\nSince the problem is in conjunctive normal form, the final formula would be the conjunction (AND) of these three clauses.\n\nNow, our task is to find a solution that satisfies all these clauses. \n\nIn this context, the constitution of the clauses hints at the fact that all clauses have x3 and x2, and the first one contains x1 while the others contains -x1. This suggests that satisfying x3 and x2 as true will satisfy all the clauses regardless of the value of x1. \n\nTherefore, the assignment x1=False, x2=True, x3=True is a valid solution. \n\nanswer: {x1=False, x2=True, x3=True}"
