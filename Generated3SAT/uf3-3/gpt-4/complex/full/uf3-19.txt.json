The DIMACS format expresses each clause as a set of literal, where each literal represents a boolean variable or its negation, and it is terminated with a 0. \n\nThe clauses in the given input are:\n1. (1 OR 3 OR NOT 2)\n2. (1 OR NOT 2 OR NOT 3)\n3. (NOT 2 OR 1 OR NOT 3)\n\nLet's follow this process:\n\n1) As all clauses contain \"1\" as a variable, let's set 1 = true.\n\n3) In the first two clauses, the literal \"NOT 2\" appears. Since 1 is true, to satisfy these clauses \"NOT 2\" has to be false. Therefore, 2 is true.\n\n4) Now, let's consider the third variable. It appears in the first clause as \"3\" and as \"NOT 3\" in the second and third clauses.  Since 1 and 2 are already true, to satisfy all the clauses, we need to assign 3 as false.\n\nSo, if we let 1 = true, 2 = true, and 3 = false, then we see that all conditions are met. \n\nanswer: 1=true, 2=true, 3=false."
