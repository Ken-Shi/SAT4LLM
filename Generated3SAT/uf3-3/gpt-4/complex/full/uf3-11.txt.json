                "content": "To solve the given problem, we need to use a method known as the SAT-solver that helps us to find a solution for the Boolean satisfiability problem. Here, each clause has a list of numbers and zero at the end. Each number corresponds to a variable and its sign indicates the kind of literal. \n\nIn this case, we have 3 clauses:\n\n1. The first clause (3 2 1 0) means that at least one of the variables x3, x2, x1 is True.\n2. The second clause (-2 3 1 0) means that at least one of the variables \u00acx2, x3, x1 is True.\n3. The third clause (3 -2 -1 0) means that at least one of the variables x3, \u00acx2, \u00acx1 is True.\n\nNow, for each clause, we have to select a literal that satisfies that clause. \n\n- For the first clause, we can select x1 as True.\n- For the second clause, we can select x3 as True (x1 is already selected as True).\n- For the third clause, x3 is already made True, so this clause is satisfied.\n\nBy this way, we have: x1 = True, x2 = False, x3 = True (as \u00acx2 = True, so x2 = False)\n\nHence, the solution becomes {x1=True, x2=False, x3=True}\n\nAnswer: {x1=True, x2=False, x3=True}"
