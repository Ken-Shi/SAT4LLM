                "content": "The problem provided is in a format designed to be easily interpreted by a computer program. It uses Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and is part of the DIMACS format often used for specifying instances of the SAT problem.\n\nA few things to understand before we solve the problem:\n\nCNF is the conjunction(dependent) of one or more clauses, where a clause is a disjunction(independent) of literals.\n\nA literal is either a variable, this case 1, 2 and 3 or the negation of a variable -1, -2 or -3.\n\nFrom the given problem,\n\np cnf 3 3 => **3 -** the total number of variables, **3 -** the total number of clauses.\n\nNow, moving on to the clauses:\n\n3 1 2 0 - This means 3 V 1 V 2 (where V denotes 'or'). It implies at least one of the literals (3,1,2) must be true or 1.\n\n-3 -1 2 0 - This means -3 V -1 V 2 OR NOT 3 OR NOT 1 OR 2. It implies not 3 and not 1 OR 2 must be true or 1.\n\n-1 -3 2 0 - This means -1 V -3 V 2 OR NOT 1 OR NOT 3 OR 2. It implies not 1 and not 3 OR 2 must be true or 1.\n\nSo now, guess and confirm a solution, for example: 1=0, 2=1 and 3=0.\n\n1. 1st clause: 3 or 1 or 2 => 0 or 0 or 1= 1\n2. 2nd clause: not 3 or not 1 or 2 => 1 or 1 or 1= 1\n3. 3rd clause: not 1 or not 3 or 2 => 1 or 1 or 1= 1\n\nAll clauses evaluate to 1, so our guess is a solution.\n\nAnswer: 1=0, 2=1, 3=0."
