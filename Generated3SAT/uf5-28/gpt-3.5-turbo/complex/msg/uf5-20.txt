To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to find a satisfying assignment of truth values to the 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) that makes all the clauses true.

Here are the clauses expressed in a more readable format:
-5 -2 -3
-5 2 -3
-4 -3 5
1 5 -3
5 1 -2
-4 -1 -2
5 3 1
3 5 1
-4 1 2
-2 1 -4
3 -2 -1
-2 5 -4
5 1 3
1 -3 2
-2 -3 -4
-3 -4 5
4 2 1
-3 -2 -4
-3 -4 -2
-1 -3 -4
-1 -2 -4
-2 1 5
-2 1 -4
-4 1 -2
1 5 -2
-5 1 -3
5 -2 1
5 4 1

Let's analyze the clauses:
- To satisfy the first clause, we must set 5 = false, 2 = false, and 3 = false (unsatisfied)
- To satisfy the second clause, we must set 5 = false, 2 = true, and 3 = false (satisfied)
- To satisfy the third clause, we must set 4 = false, 3 = false, and 5 = true (unsatisfied)
- Continue this process for all clauses

After evaluating all the clauses, we found that there is no satisfying assignment that makes all clauses true. Therefore, the problem is unsatisfiable.

answer: UNSATISFIABLE
