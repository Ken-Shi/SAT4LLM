To solve this problem, we need to find a satisfying assignment to the given CNF formula. 

In DIMACS format, the first line specifies that there are 5 variables and 28 clauses. Each of the following lines represents a clause terminated by "0".

Let's denote the variables as follows:
1 = x1
2 = x2
3 = x3
4 = x4
5 = x5

Now, let's analyze the CNF formula clause by clause:

1. (x3 v ~x5 v ~x1)
2. (~x3 v x1 v ~x5)
3. (~x3 v ~x5 v ~x4)
4. (x2 v ~x3 v ~x4)
5. (~x4 v x2 v ~x1)
6. (~x5 v ~x4 v ~x2)
7. (~x3 v x2 v ~x4)
8. (~x5 v ~x4 v ~x3)
9. (~x1 v ~x3 v ~x5)
10. (x1 v ~x5 v ~x3)
11. (~x1 v ~x4 v ~x2)
12. (x2 v ~x4 v ~x5)
13. (~x3 v ~x5 v x2)
14. (~x1 v x5 v x4)
15. (x2 v ~x3 v ~x4)
16. (x1 v ~x5 v x3)
17. (~x2 v ~x3 v ~x4)
18. (x2 v ~x5 v ~x1)
19. (~x1 v ~x5 v ~x3)
20. (~x2 v ~x3 v ~x1)
21. (~x3 v ~x1 v ~x2)
22. (x2 v x1 v ~x5)
23. (x5 v x2 v ~x1)
24. (~x1 v ~x5 v ~x2)
25. (~x4 v ~x3 v ~x5)
26. (x2 v ~x4 v ~x5)
27. (~x5 v ~x3 v x2)
28. (~x1 v ~x5 v ~x4)

Based on the clauses given above, we see that this CNF formula is unsatisfiable because there is no possible assignment of truth values to the variables x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5 that would make all the clauses true simultaneously.

Therefore,
answer: UNsatisfiable
