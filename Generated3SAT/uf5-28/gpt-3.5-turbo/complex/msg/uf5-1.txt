To solve this SAT problem, we can use a SAT solver which will give us a satisfying assignment if it exists.

However, we can also analyze the problem manually by trying to simplify the clauses:
1. From clause 4, we have -3 and -5. This indicates we need to choose the positive form of variable 3 and 5.
2. From clause 7, we have -2 and -5. This indicates we need to choose the positive form of variable 2 and 5.
3. From clause 11, we have 1 and 5. This indicates we need to choose the positive form of variable 1 and 5.
4. From clause 12, we have -2 and -3. This indicates we need to choose the positive form of variable 2 and 3.
5. From clause 17, we have -2 and -1. This indicates we need to choose the positive form of variable 1 and 2.
6. From clause 23, we have -3 and -2. This indicates we need to choose the positive form of variable 2 and 3.

By analyzing these constraints, we conclude that the solution should be:
1 = True
2 = True
3 = True
4 = True
5 = True

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: 1 1 1 1 1
