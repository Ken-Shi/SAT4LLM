To solve this SAT problem, we will apply the DPLL algorithm by choosing a variable to assign a truth value to and then using unit propagation and pure literal elimination to simplify the clauses until we reach a solution.

We will start by choosing variable 1 and assigning it a truth value of True.
After assigning variable 1 to True, we will propagate this value through the clauses and simplify them accordingly:

Clause 6: 4 2 1 -> True - Simplify to (2 4)
Clause 9: -3 -5 4 -> True - Simplify to (-3 -5)
Clause 10: 1 5 -3 -> True - Simplify to (5 -3)
Clause 11: 1 -4 5 -> True - Simplify to (-4 5)
Clause 13: 4 -3 2 -> True - Simplify to (2 4)
Clause 15: 1 5 -3 -> True - Simplify to (5 -3)
Clause 18: 2 4 5 -> True - Simplify to (2 4)
Clause 19: -5 -3 1 -> True - Simplify to (-5 -3 1)
Clause 21: 1 -5 4 -> True - Simplify to (-5 4)
Clause 23: 1 2 -3 -> True - Simplify to (2 -3)
Clause 24: 2 4 1 -> True - Simplify to (2 4)
Clause 25: 2 -3 1 -> True - Simplify to (2 -3)
Clause 26: -1 4 -3 -> True - Simplify to (-1 -3)

Now, we see that all remaining clauses contain only the variables 2, 4, -3, -5. Therefore, we can assign the truth values as follows:

Variable 2: True
Variable 4: True
Variable -3: True
Variable -5: False

Therefore, the satisfying assignment for this SAT problem is:
1 = True
2 = True
3 = True
4 = True
5 = False

answer: 1 2 3 4 -5
