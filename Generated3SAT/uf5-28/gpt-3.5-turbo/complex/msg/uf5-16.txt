To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to analyze the clauses provided and determine if there exists a satisfying assignment that makes all of them true. 

We have 5 variables and 28 clauses in total. Let's go through each clause briefly:

1. 4 3 1: At least one of these three variables must be true.
2. -5 3 2: At least one of these three variables must be true.
3. 4 -5 3: At least one of these three variables must be true.
4. 5 3 4: At least one of these three variables must be true.
5. 3 -4 -5: At least one of these three variables must be true.
6. 1 -4 3: At least one of these three variables must be true.
7. 2 1 3: At least one of these three variables must be true.
8. 3 -2 4: At least one of these three variables must be true.
9. 2 3 5: At least one of these three variables must be true.
10. 4 -5 1: At least one of these three variables must be true.
11. -2 1 3: At least one of these three variables must be true.
12. -5 3 2: At least one of these three variables must be true.
13. 2 -5 3: At least one of these three variables must be true.
14. 1 3 2: At least one of these three variables must be true.
15. 1 4 3: At least one of these three variables must be true.
16. -5 4 3: At least one of these three variables must be true.
17. 1 -5 2: At least one of these three variables must be true.
18. -5 -2 4: At least one of these three variables must be true.
19. 1 3 -2: At least one of these three variables must be true.
20. -2 1 3: At least one of these three variables must be true.
21. -2 4 1: At least one of these three variables must be true.
22. -5 1 2: At least one of these three variables must be true.
23. 4 -5 2: At least one of these three variables must be true.
24. 4 1 -5: At least one of these three variables must be true.
25. 2 1 -5: At least one of these three variables must be true.
26. 2 3 -1: At least one of these three variables must be true.
27. 3 4 2: At least one of these three variables must be true.
28. 4 5 1: At least one of these three variables must be true.

Now, we would convert this problem into a Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) by combining all these clauses. 

This is a Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) and there are many algorithms to solve SAT problems. One common algorithm is the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm.

We can now feed this CNF form of clauses into a SAT solver to obtain the solution.

answer: SATISFIABLE, One possible solution would be: 
1 2 3 4 5
