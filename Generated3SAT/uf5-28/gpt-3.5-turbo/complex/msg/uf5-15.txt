To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use a SAT solver to determine the assignment of variables that satisfies all the clauses. 

The DIMACS format shows that there are 5 variables and 28 clauses in the SAT problem. Each line represents a clause, with the numbers being the literals that compose the clause. A "0" at the end of the line separates different clauses.

We will use a SAT solver to find the solution.
