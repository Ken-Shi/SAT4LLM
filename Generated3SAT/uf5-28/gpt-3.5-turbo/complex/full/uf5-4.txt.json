We cannot satisfy the clause -1 2 -5, because there is no way to have both variables 1 and 5 false while variable 2 is true.\n2. We can satisfy the clause -1 5 4 by setting variable 4 to true.\n3. We can satisfy the clause 4 2 -1 by setting variable 2 to true.\n4. We can satisfy the clause 2 -4 -5 by setting variable 2 to true.\n5. We can satisfy the clause 2 1 4 by setting variable 1 to true.\n6. We can satisfy the clause -4 2 1 by setting variable 4 to false.\n7. We can satisfy the clause -5 4 -1 by setting variable 4 to false.\n8. We can satisfy the clause -5 -3 2 by setting variable 3 to false.\n\nBased on these assignments, we can see that the assignment {-1, 4, 2, 1, 3} satisfies all the clauses. Therefore, the problem is satisfiable.\n\nanswer: {-1, 4, 2, 1, 3}"
