From clause 4, we have -3 and -5. This indicates we need to choose the positive form of variable 3 and 5.\n2. From clause 7, we have -2 and -5. This indicates we need to choose the positive form of variable 2 and 5.\n3. From clause 11, we have 1 and 5. This indicates we need to choose the positive form of variable 1 and 5.\n4. From clause 12, we have -2 and -3. This indicates we need to choose the positive form of variable 2 and 3.\n5. From clause 17, we have -2 and -1. This indicates we need to choose the positive form of variable 1 and 2.\n6. From clause 23, we have -3 and -2. This indicates we need to choose the positive form of variable 2 and 3.\n\nBy analyzing these constraints, we conclude that the solution should be:\n1 = True\n2 = True\n3 = True\n4 = True\n5 = True\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nanswer: 1 1 1 1 1"
