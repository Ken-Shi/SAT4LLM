To solve SAT problems, we can use an algorithm such as DPLL (Davis?Putnam?Logemann?Loveland), which is based on the concept of backtracking and unit propagation. It is a systematic way of trying out all possible combinations of the variables but with some intelligence that reduces the amount of computation needed.

Here in our problem, there are five variables which can be mapped to either true or false. Line of thoughts would be to first interpret the problem, where each line gives a disjunction of literals (variables or their negations). A '0' at the end signals the end of a clause. The goal is to find an assignment of true/false to each variable such that every clause contains at least one true literal.

We start by identifying unit clauses, i.e., clauses with only one literal, but there are none in this problem. Next, we can try pure literal elimination, i.e., if a variable occurs with only one polarity in all clauses, it can safely be assigned a value that makes all these literals true. But again, in this problem, there doesn't seem to be such literals.

At this point we would have to start trying out values. Suppose we try 1=True. This immediately satisfies clauses 1, 6, 7, 13, 14, 17, but doesn't violate any others yet.

We then check for unit propagation. A unit clause in the remaining clauses is [-5, 3, 2] (since 1 is already set to True, the clause converts to [-5,3]). We can set 3=True, which reduces multiple clauses, but do not violate any. 

Continuing in this way, testing each variable and backtracking where necessary, one possible solution to the problem might emerge.

answer: {1=True, 2=False, 3=True, 4=False, 5=True} 
NOTE: The SAT problem does not usually have a unique solution. The final answer can differ based on the variables picked to assign values first.
