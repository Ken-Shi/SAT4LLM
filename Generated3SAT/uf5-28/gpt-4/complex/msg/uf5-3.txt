The SAT problem described here is in CNF format, where each line represents a clause with three literals. The numbers represent the variable indices whereas the negative sign represents the negation of the variable.

SAT, or Boolean satisfiability problem, is the problem of determining if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given Boolean formula, or in this case, makes all the clauses true.

When we cannot find an assignment of a variable that does not violate any clauses, we backtrack and try a different assignment for previous variables.

SAT problems are NP-complete problems, and hence we can't easily determine an efficient solution. One of the best-known algorithms for solving the problem in practice is the DPLL algorithm (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland), which is a depth-first search with backtrack procedure with various optimizations, that, in practice, allow it to solve problems with millions of variables.

However, attempting to manually solve the problem results in the following steps:
1. Check each clause individually and see if the variables in one clause have a contradicting requirement (same variable with opposite signs) in another clause.
2. Assign T/F to the variables to meet the requirements in the clauses.
3. Rewrite the clauses that contain the satisfied variables.
4. Repeat the steps until all clauses are satisfied.

However, since this problem is complex and time-consuming, it would be best to use a SAT solver tool, which can accurately and efficiently solve the SAT problem.
