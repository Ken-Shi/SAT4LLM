To solve this we can use the DPLL algorithm, which is a form of the backtracking algorithm specifically to solve the SAT problem.

Let's trying assigning variables (we have 5 variables based on the problem statement):

- First, we assign 1 to true. This simplifies clauses 2, 6, 14, 15, 17, 19, 24, 26, and 28.

- Then we assign 2 to false. This simplifies clause 1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 16, and 18.

- Now, we assign 3 to true. This simplifies clause 5, 8, 10, 11, and 27.

- Next, 4 can be assigned to false. This leaves us with clauses 4, 21, and 23.

- Lastly, we can assign 5 to true. Now, all the clauses are satisfied.

So, the satisfying assignment is:

Answer: 1=true, 2=false, 3=true, 4=false, 5=true.
