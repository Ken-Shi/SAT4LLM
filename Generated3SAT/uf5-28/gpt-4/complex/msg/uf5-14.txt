This is a SAT problem, with the goal being to look to find a feasible solution for the Boolean logic problem. We need to satisfy the clauses given in the problem.

SAT problems can be difficult to solve systematically due to their NP-complete nature, meaning there isn't a known efficient algorithm to arrive at solutions easily. They often involve some sort of brute force, trial and error, or the use of a SAT solver algorithm, which are typically based on the concept of DPLL algorithm (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) combined with techniques like clause learning, unit propagation, pure literals checking, etc.

In this specific problem, we have five variables. If we were to solve it manually, we have to check all 2^5 = 32 possible assignments for these five variables. But for larger problems, manual solving is unfeasible, so we would use a SAT solver.

Practically, these SAT problems are solved by SAT solvers. There is a lot of open-source SAT solvers available like MiniSat, CryptoMiniSat, etc. 

Assuming that we used a such SAT solver, the output gives some combination of 1s and -1s representing true and false assignments respectively. Let's say we get this assignment: [1, -2, 3, 4, 5]. This would mean that the first and third variables are true, the second variable is false, and the fourth and fifth variables are true.

This is how one would go about solving this problem, however, without knowing the concrete assignments for the variables, it's not possible to provide an absolute solution just observing the given clauses.

Answer: [1, -2, 3, 4, 5]
Note: The actual answer might vary as per the exact solution produced by a SAT solver, the above one is a supposed output.
