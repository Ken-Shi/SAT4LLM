This simplifies clauses 2, 6, 14, 15, 17, 19, 24, 26, and 28.\n\n- Then we assign 2 to false. This simplifies clause 1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 16, and 18.\n\n- Now, we assign 3 to true. This simplifies clause 5, 8, 10, 11, and 27.\n\n- Next, 4 can be assigned to false. This leaves us with clauses 4, 21, and 23.\n\n- Lastly, we can assign 5 to true. Now, all the clauses are satisfied.\n\nSo, the satisfying assignment is:\n\nAnswer: 1=true, 2=false, 3=true, 4=false, 5=true."
