                "content": "In the given instance, we have a conjunction of clauses in CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form). Each line after the first represents a clause and ends with '0'. A clause is a disjunction of literals and is true if any of the literals is true. A literal is a variable or its negation.\n\nTo solve this, we can apply a version of the DPLL algorithm (named after its creators Davis, Putnam, Logemann and Loveland). DPLL is the base of most modern SAT solvers.\n\n1. Simplification: If a clause contains a literal that is true, then the whole clause is true and we can remove the clause. If a clause contains a literal that is false, then we can remove that literal from the clause. Furthermore, if a clause becomes empty (which means all its literals are false), then the whole formula is unsatisfiable.\n\n2. Unit propagation: If a clause is a unit clause (i.e., it contains a single unassigned literal), then this clause can only be satisfied by assigning the necessary value to make this literal true. After setting a variable we need to simplify the formula.\n\n3. Pure literal elimination: If a literal appears with only one polarity in the formula, then we can satisfy those clauses by assigning the necessary value to the literal.\n\n4. Guessing: If none of the previous operations can be applied, then we choose a variable that has not been assigned yet and try both possible truth values.\n\n5. Learning and Backtracking: If we find the formula unsatisfiable with the current assignments, then we backtrack and try a different set of assignments.\n\nApplying these steps to the given instance, we have:\n\nAfter analyzing the clauses, the problem can easily be figured out that the only values that will cause the CNF to be true are 1 for every variable, as there is no negated variable in the major clauses. Which means the answer is: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.\n\nanswer: 1 1 1 1 1"
