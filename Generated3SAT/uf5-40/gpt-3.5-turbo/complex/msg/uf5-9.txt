To solve this problem, we will convert the given CNF formula into a SAT formula:

1. The first line indicates that there are 5 variables and 40 clauses in the formula.
2. Each line after that represents a clause in the formula.
3. Each clause is a disjunction of literals separated by space, with a '0' at the end.

Now, we can apply a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment for this formula.

answer: Unsatisfiable
