To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to apply the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. The problem is represented in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) with a total of 5 variables and 40 clauses.

Here is a brief overview of the DPLL algorithm:
1. Start with an empty interpretation and set of clauses.
2. Apply unit propagation rules to simplify the clauses and interpretations.
3. Choose a variable and assign a truth value.
4. Recursive backtracking - if the assignment leads to a conflict, backtrack to the previous decision and try the other truth value.

Let's begin by applying the DPLL algorithm:

1. Start with empty interpretation and clauses.

2. Apply unit propagation:
   - From clause 1: Variable 4 must be true.
   - From clause 2: Variable 1 must be true.

3. Choose a variable and assign a truth value.
   Let's start with variable 1 as true.

4. Apply unit propagation:
   - From clause 15: Variable 5 must be false.
   - From clause 16: Variable 2 must be false.

5. Choose a variable and assign a truth value.
   Let's select variable 2 as false.

6. Apply unit propagation:
   - From clause 28: Variable 4 must be false.
   - From clause 33: Variable 3 must be true.

7. At this point, all variables have a definite truth value based on unit propagation. Let's check the consistency of the remaining clauses:
   - Clauses 3, 26, 30, 31 are satisfied.
   - Clauses 5, 9, 19, 21, 24, 34 are violated.

Since there are violated clauses and no more possible assignments, we have a conflict. Therefore, the solution cannot be satisfied.

answer: UNSATISFIABLE
