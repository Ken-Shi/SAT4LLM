To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can apply the following steps:

1. We will use a SAT solver or the DPLL algorithm to find a satisfying assignment for the given CNF formula.

2. The CNF formula has 5 variables and 40 clauses.

3. We will convert the CNF formula into conjunctive normal form (CNF) format.

4. Run the SAT solver tool (such as z3, MiniSat, Glucose, etc) on the CNF formula to find a satisfying assignment.

5. The solution can be obtained by evaluating the variables based on the satisfying assignment found.

Using a SAT solver, we find the satisfying assignment for the given CNF formula:

answer: 1 -2 3 -4 5
