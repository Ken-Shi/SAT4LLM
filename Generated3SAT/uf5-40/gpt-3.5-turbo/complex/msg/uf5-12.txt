To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. This algorithm involves recursively assigning truth values to variables and simplifying the formula based on these assignments until a satisfying assignment is found or it is determined that no satisfying assignment exists.

First, let's analyze the given CNF formula:
p cnf 5 40
-5 -1 4 0
-1 -5 2 0
-2 -4 -3 0
...
-1 -4 3 0

The formula has 5 variables and 40 clauses.

Let's start by making some logical deductions using unit propagation and pure literal elimination. Then we can begin assigning truth values to variables.

1. From clause -1 -5 2 0, we can deduce that variable 4 must be True.
2. Now, we simplify the formula and propagate this information:
   - -2 -4 -3 0 becomes -2 3 0
3. From clause -2 3 1 0, we can deduce that variable 5 must be False.
4. Simplifying the formula and propagating this information:
   -2 -3 -5 0 becomes -2 -3 0
5. From clause -2 -3 0, we can deduce that variable 2 must be False.
6. Simplifying the formula and propagating this information:
   -4 -3 0 becomes -3 0

Now, we have a conflict (-3 0), which means our deductions led to a contradiction. Therefore, the original formula is unsatisfiable. 

answer: unsatisfiable
