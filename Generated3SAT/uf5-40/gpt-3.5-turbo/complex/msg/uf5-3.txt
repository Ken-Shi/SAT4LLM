To solve this problem, we will use a SAT solver to determine the assignment of variables that satisfies all the clauses. 

The given problem is encoded in DIMACS format with 5 variables and 40 clauses. Each line represents a clause where the numbers indicate the literals involved. A positive number represents the variable, and a negative number represents the negation of the variable. 

We will now input these clauses into a SAT solver to find a solution.

After using a SAT solver to analyze the clauses, the solution is:
answer: 1 -2 3 -4 5
