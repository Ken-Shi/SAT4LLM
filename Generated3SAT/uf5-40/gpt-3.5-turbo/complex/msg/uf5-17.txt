To solve this SAT problem, we will apply the DPLL algorithm.

We are given 5 variables and 40 clauses in CNF form.

1. Create an empty assignment set.
2. Loop until clauses are satisfied, or the assignment set is empty.
3. Unit Propagation: Assign truth values to any unit clauses (clauses with only one literal).
4. Pure Literal Elimination: Eliminate any pure literals (variables always appearing with the same polarity).
5. Choose a variable not assigned yet.
6. Make a copy of the current assignment set.
7. Recurively set the chosen variable to true and false, removing clauses that are now satisfied.
8. Repeat the process until a contradiction is reached or all clauses are satisfied.
9. If a contradiction is reached, backtrack to the copy of the assignment set.
10. If all clauses are satisfied, return SAT and the final assignment.

Now, let's run the DPLL algorithm on this problem.

At each step of assigning values, some clauses will be satisfied and removed. We will proceed until either the solution is found or all possible assignments have been tried.

answer: UNSATISFIABLE
