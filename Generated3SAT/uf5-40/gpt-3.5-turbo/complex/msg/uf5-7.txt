To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to represent the given constraints in conjunctive normal form (CNF). Then, we can use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment if one exists.

Given constraints:
1. 5 is not true if 2 and 3 are true.
2. Either 1 and 5 are true, or 3 is true.
3. Either 4 and 1 are true, or 3 is true.
4. If 2 is true, then 1 and 4 are not true.
5. If 5 and 3 are true, then 4 is not true.
6. If 4 is true, then 1 and 2 are not true.
7. If 5 and 1 are true, then 3 is not true.
8. If 1 and 4 are true, then 5 is also true.
9. If 4 and 2 are true, then 3 is not true.
10. If 2 and 1 are true, then 5 is not true.
11. If 4, 5, and 3 are true, then 2 is also true.
12. If 2 and 1 are true, then 3 is not true.
13. If 4, 5, and 3 are true, then 1 is not true.
14. If 2 and 3 are true, then 1 is also true.
15. If 3, 4, and 5 are true, then 1 is not true.
16. If 1, 5, and 2 are true, then 3 is not true.
17. If 1, 3, and 2 are true, then 5 is not true.
18. If 3, 4, and 5 are true, then 2 is not true.

We will now run a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment for these constraints.
