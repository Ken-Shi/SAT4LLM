Each clause is terminated by a '0', and the problem is a conjunction of all these clauses. \n\nWe will feed this DIMACS format into a SAT solver, which will determine whether there exists a solution that satisfies all of the clauses.\n\nOnce the SAT solver has run, we will provide the solution as a list of variable assignments that satisfy all the clauses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer will be provided in the form of a list of variable assignments that satisfy all the clauses. \n\nAnswer: Solution not provided as the SAT problem is solved by running the program."
