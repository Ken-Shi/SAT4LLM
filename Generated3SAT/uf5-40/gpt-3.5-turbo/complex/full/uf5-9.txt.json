The first line indicates that there are 5 variables and 40 clauses in the formula.\n2. Each line after that represents a clause in the formula.\n3. Each clause is a disjunction of literals separated by space, with a '0' at the end.\n\nNow, we can apply a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment for this formula.\n\nanswer: Unsatisfiable"
