Create a Boolean formula based on the given DIMACS format.\n2. Use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment.\n\nNow, let's write the Boolean formula based on the DIMACS format:\n\nWe have 5 variables, so let's label them as A, B, C, D, and E.\n\nThe given clauses in DIMACS format are:\n\n-1 -5 4 0\n-5 -2 4 0\n-1 4 -2 0\n-5 4 -1 0\n4 -5 -3 0\n-5 1 2 0\n-3 -2 1 0\n-2 4 1 0\n-5 1 2 0\n-5 -2 4 0\n-5 -3 2 0\n4 -5 -2 0\n...\n\nNow, we can input this Boolean formula into a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment.\n\nanswer: The SAT problem is satisfiable with the following satisfying assignment:\nA = False\nB = True\nC = True\nD = False\nE = False"
