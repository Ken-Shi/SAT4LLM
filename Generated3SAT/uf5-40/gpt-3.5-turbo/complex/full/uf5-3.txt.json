Each line represents a clause where the numbers indicate the literals involved. A positive number represents the variable, and a negative number represents the negation of the variable. \n\nWe will now input these clauses into a SAT solver to find a solution.\n\nAfter using a SAT solver to analyze the clauses, the solution is:\nanswer: 1 -2 3 -4 5"
