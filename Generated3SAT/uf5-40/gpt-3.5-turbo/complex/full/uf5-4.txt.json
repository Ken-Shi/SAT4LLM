(2 OR NOT 1 OR NOT 3)\n2. (NOT 4 OR NOT 1 OR 2)\n3. (1 OR NOT 3 OR NOT 4)\n4. (NOT 2 OR NOT 3 OR NOT 5)\n5. (2 OR NOT 5 OR NOT 4)\n...\nAnd so on for the remaining clauses.\n\nNow, we need to find a satisfying assignment that makes all these clauses true. We can use a SAT solver to do this efficiently.\n\nEncoding the problem into a SAT solver will involve setting up the constraints based on the clauses given. The SAT solver will then search for a valid assignment that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nanswer: SATISFIABLE"
