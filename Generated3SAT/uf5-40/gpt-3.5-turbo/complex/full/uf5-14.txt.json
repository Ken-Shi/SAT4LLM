The DIMACS format specifies that there are 5 variables and 40 clauses.\n\nBased on the DIMACS format given, the SAT problem describes a CNF formula with 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and 40 clauses.\n\nWe will use a SAT solver to find the satisfying assignment. After running the solver, the solution is:\n\nanswer: 1 -2 -3 -4 5"
