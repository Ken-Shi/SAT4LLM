                "content": "In SAT problems, we are tasked with determining whether there can be assignments to variables such that all the clauses (each line) are true. \n\nIn the DIMACS format, each line represents a disjunction of literals and each literal represents a proposition (i.e., a numeral) or its negation (preceded by \"-\").\n\nIn this problem, each line contains three literals. For each literal, either the literal or its negation must be true but both can't be true at the same time. Thus, we will proceed by trial and error, assigning true or false to one literal at a time, checking whether such an assignment flows consistently through the clauses.\n\nBy inspection, we can see that literal 1 and 2 appear in many clauses. Let's assume that 1 is true. We then have to satisfy all clauses including 1. In the first clause, as 1 is true, we can ignore the rest of the clause and move to the second clause. Since 1 is already true, we just need to set 5 or 4 to true. Let's say that 5 is also true. Continuing this thought process, we assign truth values as follows: 1 -> true, 2 -> true, 3 -> false, 4 -> true, 5 -> true. We should then check all the clauses to make sure our solution is correct.\n\nAnswer: 1 2 -3 4 5\nThis notation means variable 1,2,4,5 is true and variable 3 is false."
