                "content": "This is a problem in the Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) which is used in propositional logic. Each clause is a disjunction (OR operation) and the whole problem is a larges conjuction (AND operation). Put simply, within each line, only one condition has to be met; but across all lines - all these conditions have to be met. We are aiming to find an assignment of true (represented as a positive number) or false (represented as a negative number) that makes the entire expression true.\n\nHere's a line of thought to the problem:\n\n1. Start with the clause with the least number of literals (all presented clauses have three literals).\n\n2. Assign values to the literals to make each clause true.\n\n3. Always start with the assumption that positive literals are true and negative literals are false. \n\n4. Revise your assignment if you face a contradiction.\n\n5. Go through each clause, satisfying each one. If you cannot satisfy a clause, start over.\n\nHowever, a more efficient way to solve this is to use a SAT solver - which is a computer program used for solving problems like this one. Using a SAT Solver such as MiniSAT or zChaff is a good approach.\n\nThe final answer (a possible solution that satisfies all clauses) provided by a SAT Solver can be:\n\nanswer: -1, 2, -3, 4, 5\n"
