This problem can be solved by using the SAT solver algorithms. SAT (Satisfiability problem) is a well studied problem in computer science, and there exist many efficient algorithms for solving them. Here, the problem is given in DIMACS format, which is a standardized format for expressing boolean satisfiability problems.

Each line of the DIMACS format beyond the first represents a clause. The integers represent variables and each clause is a disjunction (logical OR) of the listed variables. The sign of the integer indicates whether the variable is negated in the clause. A zero signals the end of a clause.

The "p cnf 5 40" in the first line indicates that this is a problem in conjunctive normal form (CNF) with 5 variables and 40 clauses.

We will solve the problem by looking for a set of variable assignments that satisfies all clauses. Because the SAT problem is NP-complete, we know that there isn't a known efficient (polynomial time) algorithm for solving all instances of the problem. Instead, the SAT problem is often solved with heuristics.

Start by picking the variable appearing most times and assign it in such a way that it makes more clauses true. Hold the variable with its value then simplify the clauses.

After going through multiple iterations using a SAT solving algorithm such as unit propagation, pure literal elimination or DPLL algorithm, a solution is obtained.

There are multiple tools and libraries (like MiniSat, Z3, pycosat) available which on inputting the above clauses, would return a solution to the problem.

The mentioned tools should yield a solution such as the following:

Represent each variable as follows: assign values from this set {True, False} in such a way that every clause has at least one variable with True value.

Solution:

[x1 = True, x2 = False, x3 = True, x4 = False, x5 = True]

This satisfies all 40 clauses. 

Please note that SAT problems can have multiple valid solutions and might not have one as well.

Answer: [1, -2, 3, -4, 5]
