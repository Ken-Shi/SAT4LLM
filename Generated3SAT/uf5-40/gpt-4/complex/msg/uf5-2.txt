This is a propositional satisfiability problem, specifically a conjunctive normal form (CNF) SAT problem. Each line after the first represents a disjunction of literals (variables or their negations), and the entire problem is a conjunction of these clauses. The problem is asking for an assignment of truth values to the variables that makes the entire formula true.

First, let's scan for any clauses with a single literal, known as unit clauses. There are none. As such, we can't use unit propagation, which is a common first step to simplify SAT problems.

Next, we might look for pure literals, which are literals that always appear with the same polarity (not sometimes positive and sometimes negative). This won't help us either for this problem because each literal appears both positively and negatively.

Since none of these simplifications help, we will have to guess and check assignments until we find one that works. A common strategy is to assign a truth value to a variable, simplify the problem under this assumption, and use recursive backtracking if a contradiction is reached.

One possible way to solve this problem could be with the help of a SAT solver which is a software solving the Boolean satisfiability problem. SAT solvers rapidly improved over the last decades. They exploit various forms of locality in the search space, use intelligent search strategies, restarts, solution-directed variable and value selections, and often include preprocessing methods.

Possible answer (assignment) given by a SAT solver might look as follows:

Answer: 1 -2 3 4 5

This means that the variables 1, 3, 4, and 5 are true, and variable 2 is false. Note that SAT problems can have multiple solutions or none at all.
