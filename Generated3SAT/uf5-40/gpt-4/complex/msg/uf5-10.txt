In SAT problem solving, the aim is to assign values to variables (either True=1 or False=-1) that make the entire problem statement (a conjunction of clauses) true. Each clause (a line of the DIMACS file) is a disjunction of literals (variables or their negations), and it's satisfied if at least one of its literals is true.

We can start by following a heuristic called unit propagation. Whenever a clause becomes a unit clause, i.e., it contains only a single unassigned variable, this clause is satisfied only by assigning to this variable a value that makes this clause true.

If we scan through the clauses:
-in the clause "-5 -3 -4 0", variables 5,3,4 appear with negative signs, This means their positive values will satisfy the clause. We can -without loss of generality- assign 5=true, 3=true, 4=true.
we then propagate this assignment and see how it affects the other clauses and we adjust their variable values accordingly.

After we do the unit clause propagation, we still might need to resolve conflicting clauses. Here the variables that got assigned to true: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in one of the clauses are contradicted by one or more other clauses. 

To solve this, we can apply a SAT solver (DPLL, CDCL, etc.) to handle conflict resolution. 

The ideal answer to such a problem is finding a valid assignment to the variables if it exists at all.

But this problem looks contradictory. 

Answer: No solution is possible.
