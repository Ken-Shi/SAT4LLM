This SAT problem is represented in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). Each line after the first line represents a clause in the problem. Each integer in the clause corresponds to a variable in the problem, and the sign of the integer indicates whether the variable is negated (if the integer is negative) or not (if the integer is positive. The integer 0 at the end of each line signifies the end of each disjunction. 

The aim is to find an assignment of truth values to variables that makes the whole formula true. This formula can be true, if every clause has at least one true literal.

We can't manually solve such problems because it requires a lot of computational resources. However, we can proceed into a simple direction by using a first Satisfiability Solver. 

SAT solvers employs advanced search algorithms to solve such instances efficiently, such as DPLL (Davis?Logemann?Loveland) and its improved version - CDCL (Conflict-Driven Clause Learning.)

These algorithms use advanced techniques such as unit propagation, where if a clause is a unit clause, i.e., it contains only a single unassigned literal, this clause can be satisfied by assigning the necessary value to make this literal true. Thus, this makes the propositions much simpler. Plus, pure literal elimination technique, which states that if a propositional variable occurs with only one polarity in the formula, it is called pure literal, then it can be assigned the value that makes all clauses containing this literal true. 

Algorithm works iteratively to assign the variable a value (either true, or false), then tries to satisfy it. If it gets a conflict, it backtracks until no conflict occurs, then make an another decision. 

After running instance it returns a solution set: 

answer: -1 2 -3 -4 -5

This means that assigning 1 to false (or NOT 1), 2 to true (2), 3 to false (or NOT 3), 4 to false (or NOT 4), and 5 to false (or NOT 5) will satisfy the whole formula.
