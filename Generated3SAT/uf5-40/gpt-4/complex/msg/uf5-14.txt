This SAT problem is written using the DIMACS format, which represents a propositional formula in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). Each non-zero number stands for a literal (whereas negative and positive values denote negated and non-negated literals, respectively) and 0 marks the end of a disjunction of literals (a clause). 

Let's solve the problem step by step:

Observe the assignments that are necessarily fixed. For example, because literal 2 only appears as positive throughout the clauses, it has a fixed value of 1. This positive assignment prevents any clause only containing negative 2 from being satisfied, but there are no such clauses in this problem, so there's no issue here.

By substitive positve '2', we can remove clauses '-2 -1 3 0' and '2 -5 -3 0'.

Other literals may follow the same reasoning, but we are currently limited to processing positive literals. 

We can then simplify our problem and eliminate more terms by affirming positive literals that have occurred in at least one binary clause. 

Repeating this process until we can't simplify it further, we can compute the assignment for the literals.

For example, we can assign positive values to literals 1, 2, 5, and negative values to literals: -3, -4 (because literals 3 and 4 do not appear as positive in any of the binary clauses).

Giving -3 assignment of 0 leads to assignment 1 to literal 1 in clause '1 3 -4 0' and literal 1 in clause '2 -3 -1 0', for example.
 
After these computation and substitutions, we have a solution for the given SAT problem.

Answer: (Lit 1 = True, Lit 2 = True, Lit 3 = False, Lit 4 = False, Lit 5 = True)
