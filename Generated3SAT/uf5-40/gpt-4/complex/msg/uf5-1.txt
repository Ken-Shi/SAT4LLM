The problem presented above is a boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) problem. This type of problem is a decision problem which aims to determine if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given boolean formula. 

Before decoding this problem, it helps to understand the formatting. This problem is presented in DIMACS format and consists of clauses (lines). Each clause is a disjunction of literals (where each literal is a variable or its negation) that ends with 0. The number before "cnf" denotes the total number of variables, while the number after "cnf" denotes the number of clauses. 

The problem can be solved by assigning boolean values to the variables in a way that makes the entire formula true. In other words, we have to find an assignment of values (either true or false) to the variables (represented by numbers) so that every clause (line before 0) has at least one true literal. 

To solve this, we can use a SAT solver, which is a tool used to determine the satisfiability of boolean logic problems. However, it might pose difficulty in describing the entire thought process it undertakes as it is usually complex and involves several algorithms.


Please note that, multiple solutions may exist for this problem, depending on the order of literals processed by the solver.

Following is one of many possible solutions for this problem produced by a SAT solver:

Answer: 1 -2 -3 4 5

In this solution, the variable '1' is true, '2' is false, '3' is false, '4' is true and '5' is true.
