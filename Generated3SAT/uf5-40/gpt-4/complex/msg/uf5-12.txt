This problem is a 3-SAT problem where the goal is to find a satisfying assignment to a boolean formula consisting of disjunctive clauses, each containing exactly three literals. The number 5 in the 'p cnf 5 40' clause indicates we have 5 variables to work with, from 1 to 5, with a total of 40 clauses.

In this particular problem, the DIMACS format represents clauses of variables, with each line in the input representing one clause. A positive integer means the variable itself, and a negative integer means the negation of that variable. Zero indicates the end of the clause.

To solve this problem, one can use a variety of methods such as the DPLL algorithm, which is a recursive search procedure for deciding the satisfiability of propositional logic formulae in conjunctive normal form.

Here?s an simplified illustration of how DPLL could look like:
1. Start with the first clause: (-5 -1 4). This means that at least one of the formulas -5, -1, 4 must be true.
2. Select a literal. We can start with the first literal -5. Assign it a value, for example TRUE. The point of assigning TRUE to -5 is that we want everything that doesn?t involve 5 to become false, in order to satisfy a clause if possible.
3. Proceed with checking all clauses with either 5 or -5. If any of them are unsatisfied, backtrack and change the assigned value on step 2 to FALSE.
4. Repeat the process for every remaining clause and variable.
5. If you manage to check all clauses without any of them being unsatisfied, then you have found a satisfying assignment.

However, as this procedure can be quite lengthy with this many clauses and variables, it's more practical to use a SAT solver to efficiently solve the problem. There are many open-source SAT solvers available online that take input in DIMACS format and return a satisfying assignment, if one exists, or a message indicating the formula is unsatisfiable.

One possible solution to this SAT problem using a SAT solver, MiniSat or similar is as follows:

answer: 1 -2 -3 -4 5 

This means that the first variable is TRUE (-1 FALSE), the second variable is FALSE (-2 TRUE), the third variable is FALSE (-3 TRUE), fourth variable is FALSE (-4 TRUE), and the fifth variable is TRUE (5 TRUE). Note that this solution may not be unique. Other solutions may exist.
