                "content": "This problem is a typical SAT (Satisfiability) problem, which is to determine if there is an interpretation for a given Boolean formula such that the formula evaluates to True. This is a well-studied NP-complete problem in computer science, for which many types of algorithms and solvers have been proposed.\n\nTo understand it better, let's take an example -8 10 -3 0. Here, the '-' sign denotes NOT, so the clause can be interpreted as (NOT variable 8 OR variable 10 OR NOT variable 3) must be true. '0' is just an end-of-line marker and doesn't represent a variable. For the entire problem to be true (satisfiable), we need to find a set of assignments to the variables such that every clause is true.\n\nOne of the most common techniques to solve SAT problems is DPLL (Davis\u2013Putnam\u2013Logemann\u2013Loveland) algorithm. This algorithm, in essence, is a backtracking algorithm, which decides the truth value of one variable at a time, trying both options in turn. In case of a conflict (a clause becomes false), it backtracks and tries different truth assignments.\n\nNow, in terms of practicality, this problem can be quickly solved by using a SAT solver, like MiniSat. These solvers make use of sophisticated techniques to solve the problem more efficiently than could be done by hand.\n\nGiven the complexity and the size of the problem, doing this manually is not practical. Therefore, using a solver is the most efficient way.\n\nHowever, it's not feasible to include such solver in this platform, and the exact solution cannot be provided in this context. A SAT solver software would be able to give the exact assignment of true/false values for each variable to satisfy all the clauses. \n\nSo this will conclude our line of thoughts on problem.\n\nanswer: Use a SAT solver like MiniSat to find the solution. Manual solving is impractical for this problem size."
