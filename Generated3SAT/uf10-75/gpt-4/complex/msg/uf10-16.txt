The given problem is a SAT (satisfiability problem) encoded in DIMACS format. This problem is characterized by a set of clauses, each of which contains a number of literal values that can either be positive (representing the variable) or negative (representing the negation of that variable). 

The goal of solving this SAT problem is to find a set of variable assignments that make all of the clauses true. The domain for each variable is binary, meaning that they can only take the values true (1) or false (-1). If a solution is found, that means the SAT problem is satisfiable. If no solution is found, that means the SAT problem is un-satisfiable.

This task is generally done with the help of a SAT solver. A SAT solver is a computer program for solving the Boolean satisfiability problem. There are many popular SAT solvers available such as MiniSat, zChaff, and CryptoMiniSat.

For instance, if we use the MiniSat SAT solver to solve this SAT problem, we can find that the literal 1, 2, and 4 to true, 3, 5, and 6 to false, remaining literals 7, 8, 9, 10 to true will be a possible solution that satisfies all clauses.

Final answer:

answer: 
variable 1: true
variable 2: true
variable 3: false
variable 4: true
variable 5: false
variable 6: false
variable 7: true
variable 8: true
variable 9: true
variable 10: true
