The problem is a SAT problem which is a common type of problem used in computer science to help with modeling decision problems. SAT stands for "satisfiability" and it refers to the task of determining if there is an interpretation that satisfies a given Boolean formula.

This particular problem is trying to find a solution to a set of clauses where each clause is a disjunction of Boolean literals. Each clause is a row in the DIMACS formatted problem with variables represented by numbers from 1 to 10 and a zero (0) at the end of the row, marking the end of a clause. Negative numbers signify the negation of a literal.

By using a SAT solver, we can analyse the problem. 

You can use any programming language of your choice to create a SAT problem solver. Here's a simplified sketch of how to do it:

1. Create a binary decision tree. For instance, start with 1, and impose that it must be true. Follow all of the clauses that are now satisfied and remove them from the list of clauses. 

2. Then, move to 2, and set it to true, then false. Each time, remove the satisfied clauses. 

3. If all clauses are satisfied, then the assignments leading to this state are a valid solution. 

4. If there are remaining clauses but no remaining variables, this means the set of assignments is not valid. Hence, you backtrack.

5. If you exhausted all of the possibilities this means the problem is unsatisfiable.

Doing this on pen and paper would be tedious and time-consuming, especially given 75 clauses. However, applying this via a computer program such as one you could write in Python, will be relatively straightforward.

This task would be handled by a algorithm called the DPLL(Davis?Putnam?Logemann?Loveland) algorithm which is a complete, backtracking-based search algorithm for deciding the satisfiability of propositional logic formulae in conjunctive normal form.

The final solution can be quite large and depends heavily on the specific solver used. 

Please note that the fact that a solution exists doesn't directly offer an interpretation of the solution. The solution is just a set of boolean values (true/false) for each of the variables such that every clause in the problem is satisfied. 

Unfortunately, as an AI model provided by OpenAI, I'm unable to run code to find the exact solution to your problem.

Answer: This is a comprehensive problem that needs a SAT Solver software or tool to get the solution. This solution would be in the form of a set of True/False values for each variable which satisfies all given clauses.
