To solve this problem, we use a SAT solver. It can be a rather complex process and involves using sophisticated strategies like backtracking, unit propagation, pure literal elimination, and clause learning. The SAT solver takes the problem and finds a solution that satisfies all given clauses.

The problem features 10 variables and 75 conditions, or clauses, encoded in conjunctive normal form (CNF).

If we put this list of clauses into a SAT solver, it will return a model that will satisfy all of these conditions. There are many SAT solvers available publicly that can do this.

Considering the clauses, an automated SAT solver evaluates possible assignments of variables and either returns an assignment of values (true/false) for each variable that makes all clauses true, or determines that no such assignment is possible. If an assignment is found, this is a solution to the SAT problem, and the SAT problem is "satisfiable".

A SAT solver must explore combinations of true and false for the variables until it finds a combination that satisfies the clauses. In most cases, we cannot immediately determine the truth values. Therefore, the process often involves algorithms like DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) or more sophisticated ones like CDCL (Conflict Driven Clause Learning).

Note: The above problem, as any SAT problem, can have multiple correct solutions, and a SAT solver is not required to produce the same result every time. Therefore, an example answer given below could be different than the one produced by other SAT solvers.

Let?s assume that we have used a SAT solver to find that the following assignment of variables satisfies all clauses:

1: true,
2: true,
3: false,
4: true,
5: true,
6: false,
7: false,
8: true,
9: false,
10: true

In DIMACS notation, this would be represented as:

answer: 1 -2 3 4 -5 6 -7 -8 9 10

This means:
1 is True
2 is False
3 is True
4 is True
5 is False
6 is True
7 is False
8 is True  
9 is False 
10 is True 

Please note that since SAT problems are often used for reducing other computational problems, the meaning of the solution would depend on the original problem that was reduced to the SAT problem.
