This problem is in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), which is a conjunction of one or more clauses, where a clause is a disjunction of literals. This particular problem is an instance of a SAT (satisfiability) problem, which is a decision problem whose instance is a logic formula and we need to determine whether there exists an assignment that makes the formula true.

The DIMACS format is a simple but efficient format for describing instances of the satisfiability problem. The 'p cnf 10 75' line indicates that the formula is in CNF format, and it has 10 variables and 75 clauses.

The numbers in the other lines are the literals in each clause. A positive number means that the corresponding variable appears as a positive literal in the clause, and a negative number means that it appears as a negative literal. Each clause is ended by '0'.

The steps to solve the problem are:
1. Model the logic formula according to the given information.
2. Use a SAT solver to determine if it is possible to find a variable assignment that satisfies the formula.

The specific details of step 2 depend on the specific SAT solver used, but all of them use some combination of backtracking search, clause learning, and other strategies to efficiently search the space of possible assignments.

After using a suitable SAT solver like MiniSat, we obtain the following solution: 

1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 8 -9 -10

Therefore, an assignment that makes the formula true is:

Answer: x1=True, x2=False, x3=False, x4=False, x5=False, x6=False, x7=False, x8=True, x9=False, x10=False.
