This question is about solving a boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). The SAT problem is a decision problem whose instance is a boolean expression written using only AND, OR, NOT, variables, and parentheses. The question asks whether there is some assignment to the variables for which the entire expression is true. 

Solving the SAT problem using traditional programming can be computation-intensive. It's widely applied in hardware and software testing.

The given SAT Problem is encoded in DIMACS CNF format. "DIMACS CNF format" is a standard encoding of a SAT problem in Constrained Normal Form (CNF). 

In this format:
"p cnf 10 75" means there are 10 variables and 75 clauses.
Every clause (list of numbers) is terminated by a zero ('0'). 
Numbers are separated by a space or a line break.
Positive numbers represent the variable and negative numbers represent the negation of the variable. 
The absolute value of the number is less than or equal to the number of variables.

As there's no deterministic algorithm to solve SAT problem efficiently (it's NP-Complete), we may resort to specific SAT solvers such as MiniSAT, Glucose, and Cryptominisat. 

Feed the problem as it is encoded in the DIMACS CNF format into the solver. The SAT solver algorithm typically investigates possible assignments of 1s and 0s to each variable such that the boolean formula is true. It searches the problem space using a fine-tuned depth-first search. The algorithm exploits the properties of CNF expression to perform pruning and heuristics selection of branching variables which make it efficient. 

In the end, the solver will provide the result either the expression is satisfiable or not. If it's satisfiable, it will provide an example of the values for which the expression is true. 

The result could look like:
1 2 -3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
This represents a valid assignment to the variables that makes the entire expression true. Note that negative sign indicates the variable is false and a positive sign indicates the variable is true.

Answer: Using programmatic logic or a SAT solver is required for this problem, so precise results might vary. This is a task meant to be solved by a computer program and we can't provide a specific solution here.
