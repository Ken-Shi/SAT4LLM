The problem presented in the question can be solved by using the DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) algorithm. The algorithm works based on the principles of backtracking and propagation. 

In simple terms, the DPLL algorithm takes a SAT problem (in this case provided in DIMACS format), assigns a value to a variable, simplifies the problem with that assignment and recursively checks if the simplified problem is satisfiable. If it isn't, it backtracks and tries a different assignment. It keeps on doing this until it finds a satisfying assignment or determines that the problem is unsatisfiable.

The algorithm begins by selecting a variable and tries assigning it a value (true or false). It then simplifies the remaining clauses using this assignment. If the assignment leads to a clause getting reduced to an empty clause, the assignment isn't correct. So it must backtrack and try the next value.

Propagation is used to simplify the problem. There are two forms of propagation: unit propagation and pure literal elimination. Unit propagation is applied when there exists a clause with only one unassigned variable. Pure literal elimination is applied when a variable always occurs with the same polarity (either positive or negative). These variables can be assigned the value which makes these literals true.

By performing these operations recursively, the algorithm generates a tree of solutions and search through this tree. The process could take some time for complex problems, but it ends up providing a solution if one exists.

Applying these principles to the problem at hand, the solution is:

Answer: 1 -2 -3 4 -5 -6 7 -8 9 -10
