To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use the WalkSAT algorithm which is known for efficiently solving large SAT instances. 

Step 1: Initialize a random assignment of truth values to the variables.

Step 2: For a certain number of iterations or until a satisfying assignment is found, do the following:
- Check for unsatisfied clauses in the current assignment.
- Randomly select a clause with unsatisfied literals.
- With a probability p, randomly flip one of the variables in the selected unsatisfied clause.
- With a probability (1-p), flip the variable that maximizes the number of satisfied clauses.
- Update the truth values of variables according to the chosen action.
- Repeat until a satisfying assignment is found or until the maximum number of iterations is reached.

Let's run the WalkSAT algorithm on the provided SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format:
