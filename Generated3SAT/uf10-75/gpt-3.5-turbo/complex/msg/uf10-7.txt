This problem is a SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format. The format specifies the problem properties first (in this case, 10 variables and 75 clauses) followed by the list of clauses in CNF form.

To solve this SAT problem, we can use a SAT solver like MiniSat or Z3. Running this problem through a SAT solver will provide a solution for whether the given clauses are satisfiable (i.e., there exists an assignment of true/false to the variables that makes all the clauses true) or unsatisfiable.

Answer: SATISFIABLE
