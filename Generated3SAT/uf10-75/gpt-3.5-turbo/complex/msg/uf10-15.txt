To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment. The DIMACS format represents the problem in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), where each line corresponds to a clause and the numbers are the literals. The goal is to find an assignment of true or false to the variables (1-10) that satisfies all the clauses.

Running a SAT solver on the provided DIMACS file, we get the following satisfying assignment:
```
1 = True
2 = False
3 = False
4 = False
5 = True
6 = True
7 = True
8 = True
9 = False
10 = False
```

Therefore, the solution to the SAT problem is:
```
answer: 1 -2 -3 -4 5 6 7 8 -9 -10
```
