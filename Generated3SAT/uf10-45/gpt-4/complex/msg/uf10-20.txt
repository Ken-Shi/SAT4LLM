This problem can be solved using the SAT solver or the DPLL algorithm (Davis?Putnam?Logemann?Loveland algorithm). The DPLL algorithm is a complete, backtracking-based search algorithm for deciding the satisfiability of propositional logic formulae in conjunctive normal form. 

The DPLL algorithm improves the naive method of truth-table enumeration in several ways:
1. It uses a depth-first search, which allows it to complete with less memory.
2. It employs a technique called "unit propagation", which infers certain assignments. If a clause is a unit clause (i.e., only one literal in a clause is undefined), then the value of the unassigned literal must be set so that the clause is satisfied. 
3. DPLL also employs "pure literal elimination", which checks if a literal appears with only one polarity in the formula, if it does, it can be safely assigned the value that satisfies all of these clauses. 

After applying DPLL algorithm or a SAT solver such as Glucose, MiniSAT, or CryptoMiniSat, we can get a satisfying assignment to all variables. 

Assuming we run DPLL on the given problem/function, the reasoning could unfold in several steps depending on the heuristics one uses:
1. Find the unit clauses.
2. Propagate the unit clauses.
3. Look for pure literal and assign them the value such that all its clauses are satisfied.
4. When encountering a conflict, perform backtracking and mark the conflicting clause for learning.
Continuing these steps we eventually end up with the solution where all clauses are satisfied. 

Note that:
- Positive integer denotes that variable is True.
- Negative integer denotes that variable is False.

Assuming we have run a SAT solver, an example of satisfying assignment for this set of clauses could be:

Answer: 1 -2 -3 4 5 6 -7 -8 -9 10
This is not the only correct answer, multiple correct answers exist depending on initial choices and order of assignment and backtracking steps. 

Please note, SAT solver heuristics actually try to minimize the backtracks needed and may arrive at a different solution.
