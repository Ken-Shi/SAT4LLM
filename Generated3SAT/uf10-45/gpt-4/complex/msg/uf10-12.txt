Solving SAT problems is done via a method known as the DPLL algorithm, including two main ideas: unit propagation and pure literal elimination. It also utilizes backtracking in case an assignment leads to an unsatisfiable conjunctive form.

-10 3 6 0 : Line indicates either -10, 3 or 6 must be true or could be true.
-5 2 8 0 : Line indicates either -5, 2 or 8 must be true or could be true.

This process is repeated for each line until some deductions can be made. For example, if a variable only appears as a positive (or negative) literal, it can be set to true (or false), and clauses containing this variable can be removed. 

When a variable appears both in positive and negative polarity, exploration of both assignments, true and false, is required and a depth-first search with backtracking can be used.

Considering the limitations of encoding and decoding DIMACS format by human, it is recommended to use a SAT solver (like MiniSat, CryptoMinisat, etc.). These solvers give you solutions to the problems in polynomial time.

So this is a job for a computational device, not well suited for a human or even an AI model like me as it involves interpretation of large amounts of data and computation in an advanced algorithm.

Answer: The solution should be given by a tool capable of implementing a SAT solver like MiniSat, CryptoMinisat, etc.
