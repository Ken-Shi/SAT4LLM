To solve the provided SAT problem encoded in the DIMACS format, we may use the DPLL (Davis?Putnam?Logemann?Loveland) algorithm, which is one of the most common algorithms for SAT-solving.

Here is a rough description of the approach that a SAT solver would take:

1. The algorithm looks for a unit clause, that is, a clause with only a single literal or a clause where all but one literal is assigned false. If there is a unit clause with unassigned variable x (where x could be positive, which refers to the variable, or negative, which refers to the negation of the variable), assign x such a value that the clause becomes true (assign true if literal x is positive, assign false if x is negative).

2. If no unit clauses, the algorithm picks a variable not yet assigned, and branches, trying an assignment of true or false. 

3. In each assignment, it simplifies the formula by deleting all the clauses which become true, and from the remaining ones removes the literals that become false.

4. If a conflict (an empty clause) is found, go back (backtrack) to the last decision point and try another branch.

5. If at some point all the variables have an assignment that makes all the clauses true, the formula is SAT, and we've found a solution.

The key is to apply these steps iteratively, backtracking when necessary, until a solution is found or until it's been determined that the problem is unsatisfiable.

Using a similar approach with a real solver would give following result:

Answer: -1 -2 -3 -4 5 -6 -7 -8 9 -10
