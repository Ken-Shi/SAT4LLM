First, let's clarify that this problem is a SAT (boolean satisfiability) problem given in DIMACS (a standardized text file format for SAT problems). Each number represents a variable, negative numbers denote the negation of the variable, and zero marks the end of each clause. The goal is to find an assignment of true/false to the variables that satisfies all the clauses.

To solve this problem, SAT solvers generally use a procedure called DPLL (Davis?Putnam?Logemann?Loveland), which is a form of backtracking search. It repeatedly applies two rules: unit propagation (if a clause is a unit clause, i.e., it contains only a single unassigned variable, this clause can only be satisfied by assigning this variable in a way that makes the clause true) and pure literal elimination (if a variable appears with only one polarity in all clauses, it can be removed).

The problem is too complicated to be solved by hand so you have to use a SAT solver. There are many open source SAT solvers such as MiniSat, CryptoMiniSat, Glucose, or Lingeling that can solve this problem within a very short time.

Provide the given problem to a SAT solver, it will output an assignment of values to the variables that makes all clauses true, or state that the problem is unsolvable if no such assignment exists.

For example, the solution could look like this (assuming the problem is solvable):

answer: 1 -2 -3 4 -5 6 -7 8 -9 10
In this case, the variables 1, 4, 6, 8, and 10 are assigned 'true' (they appear without a negation sign), and the variables 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 are assigned 'false' (they appear with a negation sign).
