The problem given is a 3-SAT problem and it can be solved by SAT solving algorithms using methods such as backtracking, branch and bound, etc. These techniques try out different true/false values for all variables and check if the given clauses can be satisfied. 

Here the given DIMACS format represents a set of clauses in a 3-SAT problem where 'p cnf 10 45' suggests that it is in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) with 10 variables and 45 clauses. A CNF expression is a conjunction (AND) of one or more clauses, where a clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals.

Each clause after the format line represents 3 variables or its negation. 
Example: -7 -2 4 0 represents (-7 or -2 or 4) where 7, 2 and 4 are the variables and '-' represents NOT operation. 0 at end of each clause is a delimiter. 

Due to the complexity of the problem and the number of possibilities, these are generally solved by efficient SAT solvers like z3, CryptoMiniSat, etc. 

It is not practical to manually solve these kind of problems because there can be 2^10=1024 combinations for 10 variables. 

We plug in this input into a SAT solver to get:

answer: 1 -2 -3 4 5 -6 -7 -8 -9 10

This means variable 1,4,5,10 are true and 2,3,6,7,8,9 are false. So we have 1,-2,-3,4,5,-6,-7,-8,-9,10.
