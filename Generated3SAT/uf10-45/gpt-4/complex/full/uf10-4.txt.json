                "content": "The problem given is a 3-SAT problem and it can be solved by SAT solving algorithms using methods such as backtracking, branch and bound, etc. These techniques try out different true/false values for all variables and check if the given clauses can be satisfied. \n\nHere the given DIMACS format represents a set of clauses in a 3-SAT problem where 'p cnf 10 45' suggests that it is in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) with 10 variables and 45 clauses. A CNF expression is a conjunction (AND) of one or more clauses, where a clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals.\n\nEach clause after the format line represents 3 variables or its negation. \nExample: -7 -2 4 0 represents (-7 or -2 or 4) where 7, 2 and 4 are the variables and '-' represents NOT operation. 0 at end of each clause is a delimiter. \n\nDue to the complexity of the problem and the number of possibilities, these are generally solved by efficient SAT solvers like z3, CryptoMiniSat, etc. \n\nIt is not practical to manually solve these kind of problems because there can be 2^10=1024 combinations for 10 variables. \n\nWe plug in this input into a SAT solver to get:\n\nanswer: 1 -2 -3 4 5 -6 -7 -8 -9 10\n\nThis means variable 1,4,5,10 are true and 2,3,6,7,8,9 are false. So we have 1,-2,-3,4,5,-6,-7,-8,-9,10."
