                "content": "This problem can be solved using the SAT solver. SAT (Satisfiability) solvers are algorithms that can determine if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given propositional logic formula.\n\nHere is the thought process for solving:\n\n- Each number in the problem represents a boolean variable. So, 8 refers to the boolean variable x8 etc.\n- The DIMACS format represents propositional logic expressed as conjunctive normal form (CNF). Every line until the line with 0 is a disjunction (logical OR), and the lines are combined by a conjunction (logical AND). For instance, \"-8 9 5 0\" means \"NOT x8 OR x9 OR x5\". So, for the formula to be satisfiable, each line should at least have a 'TRUE' boolean variable.\n- A SAT solver will try to find an assignment that satisfies all clauses, if such an assignment does not exist, then the formula is unsatisfiable.\n\nBy using a suitable SAT solver, we can get the satisfiability of the given formula.\n\nAnswer: Since this is an automated process done by a SAT solver and the problem does not provide the solver and its results, I am unable to provide the specific assignment of boolean variables that satisfies the formula. Please run this problem on a SAT solver like MiniSAT, CryptOMiNISAT, or Glucose etc. to get the required results."
