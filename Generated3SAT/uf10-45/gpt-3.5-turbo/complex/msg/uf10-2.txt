To solve this SAT problem, we will use the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. 

1. Initialize an empty set of assignments.
2. Pick a variable from the unassigned variables, let's say X.
3. Assign X = True and remove all clauses that are satisfied by this assignment, where X occurs.
4. Assign X = False and remove all clauses that are satisfied by this assignment, where NOT X occurs.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all clauses are satisfied, at which point we have a solution, or until we reach a contradiction, indicating that the problem has no solution.

Now, let's apply this algorithm to the given problem in DIMACS format.

Let's denote variables as follows:
1 = A, 2 = B, 3 = C, 4 = D, 5 = E, 6 = F, 7 = G, 8 = H, 9 = I, 10 = J

Converting the problem:
-1 -2 -8 0 -> -A -B -H
-9 7 1 0 -> -I G A
-1 8 5 0 -> -A H E
5 9 -1 0 -> E I -A
3 7 2 0 -> C G B
.

Applying the DPLL algorithm, we would go through the steps of selecting variables and assigning values. After working through the clauses, we would eventually come to a full assignment that satisfies all of them.

Therefore, the answer is:
answer: A = True, B = False, C = False, D = False, E = True, F = False, G = True, H = True, I = False, J = True
