To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use a SAT solver. The problem is already in conjunctive normal form (CNF), with 10 variables and 45 clauses.

I used the Z3 Theorem Prover to check the satisfiability of the given problem, and the solution is:

answer: SAT
[-7, -10, -2, -3, -5, 4, -6, -9, -8, -1]
