                "content": "To solve this SAT problem, we will use the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. \n\n1. Initialize an empty set of assignments.\n2. Pick a variable from the unassigned variables, let's say X.\n3. Assign X = True and remove all clauses that are satisfied by this assignment, where X occurs.\n4. Assign X = False and remove all clauses that are satisfied by this assignment, where NOT X occurs.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all clauses are satisfied, at which point we have a solution, or until we reach a contradiction, indicating that the problem has no solution.\n\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to the given problem in DIMACS format.\n\nLet's denote variables as follows:\n1 = A, 2 = B, 3 = C, 4 = D, 5 = E, 6 = F, 7 = G, 8 = H, 9 = I, 10 = J\n\nConverting the problem:\n-1 -2 -8 0 -> -A -B -H\n-9 7 1 0 -> -I G A\n-1 8 5 0 -> -A H E\n5 9 -1 0 -> E I -A\n3 7 2 0 -> C G B\n.\n\nApplying the DPLL algorithm, we would go through the steps of selecting variables and assigning values. After working through the clauses, we would eventually come to a full assignment that satisfies all of them.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nanswer: A = True, B = False, C = False, D = False, E = True, F = False, G = True, H = True, I = False, J = True"
