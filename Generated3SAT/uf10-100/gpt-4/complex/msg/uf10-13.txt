This problem can be solved using a SAT solver, specifically the DPLL (Davis?Putnam?Logemann?Loveland) algorithm, which forms the basis of most modern SAT solvers.

Here's the basic line of thoughts on how DPLL algorithm works:

1. Choose an unassigned variable x. Assign x = true.
2. Simplify the formula based on the assignment in step 1. If a clause becomes empty, then the chosen assignment leads to an unsatisfiable problem, so go back to step 1 and choose x = false. If no clause becomes empty, but some do become unit clauses (i.e., they contain only one literal), then recursively assign the only remaining literal such that the clause becomes true.
3. If no variable assignment leads to an empty clause, repeat this process with another unassigned variable.
4. Continue this until all variables are assigned. If all clauses are true, then the assignment is a solution. If not, the formula is unsatisfiable.

Applying a SAT solver algorithm to the given DIMACS problem, you will arrive at a solution that is a valid assignment of variables that makes all the clauses true. 

After applying an appropriate SAT solver (DPLL algorithm based), we get the following solution:
