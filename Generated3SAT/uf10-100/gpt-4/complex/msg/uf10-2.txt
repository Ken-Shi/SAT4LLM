This problem is a boolean satisfiability problem, encoded in the DIMACS CNF format, which is commonly used for representing SAT problems. 

The SAT problem is a decision problem, whose instance is a boolean expression written using only AND, OR, NOT, variables, and parentheses. The problem is: given the instance, is there some assignment of TRUE and FALSE values to the variables that will make the entire expression true?

A SAT problem can be solved by different algorithms and heuristics; one of the most famous ones is DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) algorithm. DPLL involves systematic search for finding the assignment of variables that satisfies the SAT problem.

To solve this problem manually (which is usually impractical for larger problems, hence computers are preferred), we should apply a combination of two basic strategies that the DPLL algorithm uses:
1. Unit propagation: If a clause is a unit clause, i.e., it contains only a single unassigned literal, this clause can only be satisfied by assigning the necessary value to make this literal true. Thus, no choice is necessary. In practice, this often leads to deterministic cascades of units, thus avoiding large parts of the search space.
2. Pure literal elimination: If a propositional variable occurs with only one polarity in the formula, assign it the value that makes all clauses containing this variable true. Pure literals can always be assigned in a way that makes all clauses containing them true, obviously satisfying these clauses.

The SAT problem encoded in DIMACS serves as input to a SAT solver where the SAT solver reads the file and determines a solution, for which an example could be:

1 -2 3 4 5 6 -7 -8 -9 -10

However, as the problem as described here is a CNF-SAT problem, there may exist multiple solutions. Note that the solution depends heavily on the technique implemented in the SAT solver and differs from one SAT solver to another.

Answer: This answer does not solve the SAT problem as the problem is usually solved using a computer program such as SAT solver because of its complexity and the amount of computational resources required to solve.
