Here are the steps we could use to solve this problem, which will be using the DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) algorithm, which is a complete, backtracking-based search algorithm for deciding the satisfiability of a set of propositional logic formulas in conjunctive normal form:

1- Generate a set of clauses by translating each line into a conjunction of literals: for example, convert line "10 2 -5 0" into (10 OR 2 OR NOT 5).

2- Check if the set of clauses has an empty clause. If it does, the problem has no solution.

3- Choose an unassigned variable. Assign it the value that satisfies the maximum number of unsatisfied clauses. The exact method of picking a variable and the value to assign can vary, but a common approach is picking the variable that appears in the most clauses and setting it to the value that satisfies the most clauses.

4- Simplify the set of clauses by removing any clause that is now satisfied and removing any literals that are now unsatisfied from the remaining clauses.

5- If no clauses remain, the problem is solved. If unsatisfied clauses remain but no variables, the problem is unsolvable. In any case, return the solution (the set of variable assignments) or failure.

6- Backtrack if the assumed value leads to conflict. This is done by reversing the decision of the value for the chosen variable.

7- The algorithm is recursively applied to the simplified set of clauses.

Please note that the proposed solution here is a general guideline to manually solving a SAT problem, which is a complex task usually performed by software and not by human beings due to the complexity and the size of the task, the set of presented clauses in this SAT problem is too large and solving it manually is practically not feasible.

Answer: Solving it manually is impractical, using an SAT solver program would be the best answer in this case.
