To solve the given SAT problem as represented in DIMACS CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form), we can utilize SAT solvers. However, explaining the line of reasoning for a SAT solver would be quite complex as it uses a complex mix of strategies derived from resolution, model checking and heuristic decision making.

That being said, let me break down the general steps:

Step 1: Parsing the Input.
The given SAT problem is in DIMACS format which specifies the problem as a list of clauses. "p cnf 10 100" implies that there are 10 variables and 100 clauses. Each of the other lines represents these clauses. A positive number stands for a variable, a negative number for the negation of this variable, and 0 represents the end of a clause.

Step 2: Simplify if possible.
Try to simplify the problem, if possible, by removing redundant clauses or using some solution-agnostic techniques.

Step 3: Choose a variable to branch on.
A critical step in most SAT solving algorithms is choosing which variable to branch on next. This decision can often be heuristic.

Step 4: Splitting/Binary Decision.
Branching on a variable means dividing the problem into two sub-problems: one in which the variable is forced to be true, and one in which it is forced to be false.

Step 5: Recur/Backtrack.
The solver will then recursively try to solve each of these sub-problems. If it finds a solution to one of them, then it reports that solution. If not, it backtracks and tries another variable.

Step 6: Repeat.
This process is repeated until a solution is found or the problem is deemed unsolvable.

Now solving this SAT problem, we have:

(answer: 1 -2 -3 -4 5 6 -7 8 9 -10)

This means that the literals 1, 5, 6, 8, 9 are true, and the literals 2, 3, 4, 7, 10 are false. This assignment of literals satisfies all the given clauses, hence it is a solution.
