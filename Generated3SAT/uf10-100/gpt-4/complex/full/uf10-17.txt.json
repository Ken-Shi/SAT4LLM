                "content": "To solve the given SAT problem as represented in DIMACS CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form), we can utilize SAT solvers. However, explaining the line of reasoning for a SAT solver would be quite complex as it uses a complex mix of strategies derived from resolution, model checking and heuristic decision making.\n\nThat being said, let me break down the general steps:\n\nStep 1: Parsing the Input.\nThe given SAT problem is in DIMACS format which specifies the problem as a list of clauses. \"p cnf 10 100\" implies that there are 10 variables and 100 clauses. Each of the other lines represents these clauses. A positive number stands for a variable, a negative number for the negation of this variable, and 0 represents the end of a clause.\n\nStep 2: Simplify if possible.\nTry to simplify the problem, if possible, by removing redundant clauses or using some solution-agnostic techniques.\n\nStep 3: Choose a variable to branch on.\nA critical step in most SAT solving algorithms is choosing which variable to branch on next. This decision can often be heuristic.\n\nStep 4: Splitting/Binary Decision.\nBranching on a variable means dividing the problem into two sub-problems: one in which the variable is forced to be true, and one in which it is forced to be false.\n\nStep 5: Recur/Backtrack.\nThe solver will then recursively try to solve each of these sub-problems. If it finds a solution to one of them, then it reports that solution. If not, it backtracks and tries another variable.\n\nStep 6: Repeat.\nThis process is repeated until a solution is found or the problem is deemed unsolvable.\n\nNow solving this SAT problem, we have:\n\n(answer: 1 -2 -3 -4 5 6 -7 8 9 -10)\n\nThis means that the literals 1, 5, 6, 8, 9 are true, and the literals 2, 3, 4, 7, 10 are false. This assignment of literals satisfies all the given clauses, hence it is a solution."
