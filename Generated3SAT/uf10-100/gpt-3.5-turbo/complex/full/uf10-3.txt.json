We will start by randomly assigning each variable as true or false. Then, we will iteratively flip the value of a variable in order to minimize the number of unsatisfied clauses. \n\nAfter performing a sufficient number of iterations, we will output the final assignment of the variables that satisfies the maximum number of clauses.\n\nanswer: 2 -1 3 -4 5 -6 -7 -8 -9 -10"
