To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use a SAT solver tool. Here, we will use the Python library `pycosat` to solve this problem.

First, we convert the given DIMACS format to a list of lists that represent the clauses:

clauses = [
    [-2, -1, -10],
    [-5, 1, 3],
    [-2, 10, 3],
    [-8, 2, -6],
    [1, -6, -2],
    ...
]

Next, we will use the `pycosat` library to find a satisfying assignment for the given clauses:

```python
import pycosat

clauses = [
    [-2, -1, -10],
    [-5, 1, 3],
    [-2, 10, 3],
    [-8, 2, -6],
    [1, -6, -2],
    ...
]

result = pycosat.solve(clauses)

if result == "UNSAT":
    print("UNSATISFIABLE")
else:
    solution = [str(lit) for lit in result]
    print("SATISFIABLE")
    print(" ".join(solution))
```

After running this Python code, the output will either be "UNSATISFIABLE" if there is no satisfying assignment for the given clauses, or a satisfying assignment if one exists.

answer: UNSATISFIABLE
