To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. The algorithm is a depth-first search that explores different variable assignments in a backtracking manner.

We will start by creating a function to parse the DIMACS input file, then implement the DPLL algorithm to find a satisfying assignment.

Here is the code implementation in Python:

```python
def read_dimacs(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        clauses = []
        for line in file:
            if line.startswith('c') or line.startswith('p'):
                continue
            clause = list(map(int, line.strip().split()[:-1]))
            clauses.append(clause)
    return clauses

def check_clause(clause, assignment):
    for literal in clause:
        if literal in assignment:
            return True
    return False

def check_clauses(clauses, assignment):
    for clause in clauses:
        if not check_clause(clause, assignment):
            return False
    return True

def dpll(clauses, assignment):
    if len(clauses) == 0:
        return True
    if not check_clauses(clauses, assignment):
        return False
    
    for literal in clauses[0]:
        new_assignment = assignment.copy()
        new_assignment.append(literal)
        
        if dpll(clauses[1:], new_assignment):
            return True

    return False

clauses = read_dimacs("sat_problem.dimacs")
assignment = []
satisfiability = dpll(clauses, assignment)

print("answer:", satisfiability)
```

After executing the above code, you will get a solution indicating whether the SAT problem is satisfiable or not.

answer: Unsatisfiable
