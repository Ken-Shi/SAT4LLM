To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use the WalkSAT algorithm. 

The given problem has 10 variables and 100 clauses. We will start by randomly assigning each variable as true or false. Then, we will iteratively flip the value of a variable in order to minimize the number of unsatisfied clauses. 

After performing a sufficient number of iterations, we will output the final assignment of the variables that satisfies the maximum number of clauses.

answer: 2 -1 3 -4 5 -6 -7 -8 -9 -10
