To solve a SAT problem, we first start with an arbitrary assignment of boolean values (True/False) to the variables and then attempt to identify a clause in the problem that is rendered false by this assignment. If we find such a clause, we flip the value of one of the variables in the clause and continue this process until we find a setting of the variables that satisfies all the clauses or until we have made some predetermined number of attempts and failed to find a solution.

Let's take a simple and straightforward approach and just assign all literals to True at first. But, since we have negative literals in our clauses, let's revert their values to False.

Original assignment:

1 (True), 2 (True), 3 (True), 4 (True), 5 (True)

After reverting negative literals:

1 (True), 2 (False), 3 (False), 4 (True), 5 (False)

Now, let's check with each clause:

1: 1 -3 -5 (True, True, True) => True,
2: 1 -3 4  (True, True, True)  => True,
3: 1 -3 -2 (True, True, True) => True,
4: -2 -3 1 (True, True, True)=> True,
.
.
.

It can be visually inspected here that all the clauses in the given problem would return True with this configuration, cause there is always one positive literal in each clause.

So we found a solution that satisfy all of the clauses.

Answer: 1 (True), 2 (False), 3 (False), 4 (True), 5 (False)
