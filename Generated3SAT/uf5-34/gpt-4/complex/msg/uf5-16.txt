To solve this SAT problem, we consider the problem as boolean satisfiability. We could solve the problem by utilizing a backtrack-based SAT solver algorithm. Walking through this assignment, we parse the clauses then search for a solution using this iterative approach.

The key line of thought is to find an assignment of truth values to the propositions such that each clause is satisfied. A clause is satisfied if at least one of its literals is true.

Thus there are few steps:
Parse the clauses: Each clause is a disjunction (an OR operation) of literals, each literal is either a proposition or its negation (NOT). 

Assign temporary truth values: We will calculate whether each clause is satisfied given the current truth values. 

Check for conflict: If there is conflict(loop) then backtrack and flip the assignment of the last variable picked. If there is no conflict, select an unassigned variable, and assign it a truth value then we continue in the outer loop otherwise we have found a solution.

Lastly, each SAT problem is very different and dependent on the set of constraints, and there cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach to solving them.

Applying a SAT solver algorithm to this specific problem,

Answer: The assignment for each proposition is 
1=True, 2=True, 3=False, 4=True, 5=True
