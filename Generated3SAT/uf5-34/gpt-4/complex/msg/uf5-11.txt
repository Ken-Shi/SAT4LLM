The problem encoded in a DIMACS format given is a conjunctive normal form (CNF) formula. We are to determine the assignment of variables that makes the formula true. To do this, we will use a technique known as the DPLL algorithm. 

The DPLL algorithm (named after its inventors Davis, Putnam, Logemann, and Loveland) is a search-based technique used in solving SAT problems. It involves branching, i.e., making a guess for a variable's assignment, and propagation, i.e., determining the consequences of this guess. If a contradiction is found, it backtracks to a previous assignment and tries a different guess.

Starting with the first clause as '(3 OR -5 OR 2)', we can make an initial guess. Let's start by assuming 3 is True (1), because if 3 is False(-1), it would make the next 4 clauses False.

If 3 is True, from the clause '(2 -3 -4)', the remaining values result in '(2 OR -4)', from which we can imply 2 is True and 4 is False, because if 2 is False, the leftover -4 makes it False, contradicting out supposition that the clause is True.

With 3 and 2 set to True and 4 to False, propagating these assignments leads to:

5 is True (1) [from '(2 3 5 0)', as 3 is True, 5 must be True for the clause (5 -4 1 0) to be True]
1 is True (1) [from '(5 -4 1 0)', 5 is True, 4 is False, so 1 must be True]

Now, checking every clause with these assignments, we see that everything holds.

So the final assignment is:

answer: 1: True, 2: True, 3: True, 4: False, 5: True.
