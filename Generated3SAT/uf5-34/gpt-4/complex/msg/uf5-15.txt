This DIMACS format is a way of representing Boolean formulas, where each clause is set on a line, and the variables are mentioned. The '0' at the end of each line is to mark the end of a clause. Following characters like "p cnf 5 34" help to define the problem: 5 means there are five variables, and 34 signifies that there are 34 clauses available.

The symbols have the following meanings: Positive integers stand for the variable itself, negative integers represent the negation of the variable, and '0' marks the end of a clause. For example, "3 2 1 0" is read as "(x3 OR x2 OR x1)", and "-3 2 -5 0" is "(NOT x3 OR x2 OR NOT x5)".

Next, we will consider the SAT problem that can be solved by a simple method, such as the DPLL (Davis?Putnam?Logemann?Loveland) algorithm, observing implications and contradictions, and applying some logical deduction.

Start with "3 2 1 0". We assume x3 = TRUE because if x3 = FALSE, the other two clauses must be TRUE, which may restrict our solutions.

Following the first assumption, we get implications from clauses such as "-3 2 -5 0" to set x5 = TRUE and x2 = TRUE; "-3 4 -5 0" that leads to x4 = FALSE; and "-3 -5 4 0" that leaves us with no contradiction; "-5 -1 -3 0" also leads to x1 = TRUE.

With this setting (x3 = TRUE, x5 = TRUE, x2 = TRUE, x4 = FALSE, and x1 = TRUE), we went through rest of the clauses and found no contradictions, so it seems that our settings satisfy the SAT problem.

Answer: The single solution is x1 = TRUE, x2 = TRUE, x3 = TRUE, x4 = FALSE, and x5 = TRUE. Which, in terms of 1 and 0, could also be represented as: Answer: 1 1 1 0 1.
