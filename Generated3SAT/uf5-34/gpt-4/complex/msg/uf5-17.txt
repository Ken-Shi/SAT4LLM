The problem is presented in the DIMACS format which is used to represent Boolean SATisfiability (SAT) Problems. In this format, each line after the first line represents a clause of a conjunctive normal form (CNF) formula. Each clause is terminated by zero (0).

The numbers in the clause represent literals. The absolute value of the number corresponds to the variable, and its sign corresponds to whether it is a positive or negative literal (positive if the number is positive, and negative otherwise). 

There are several methods to solve SAT problems, one of the most common methods is the DPLL (Davis?Putnam?Logemann?Loveland) algorithm. It works by continuously selecting unassigned variables, guessing their value, and then checking if the resulting formula is satisfiable.

Here, we apply DPLL method:

1. A literal that occurs in only one clause with positive polarity can be made true.

2. If a clause contains one variable that is not yet assigned and whose truth value is undefined, that variable can be assigned in such a way that the clause becomes true.

3. If a clause has all of its literals assigned false except one, the remaining literal can be assigned in a way to make the clause true.

Continuing with these steps iteratively and trying to simplify the clauses, we get:
{1 = true, 2 = false, 3 = false, 4 = false, 5 = true}

Therefore, the answer to this problem is:

Answer: 1 -2 -3 -4 5
