Parsing the problem - The first line tells us there are 5 variables and 34 clauses in conjunctive normal form (CNF).\n2. When propagating through units (finding clauses with only one unassigned variable), the solver will assign truth values to these literals in such a way that the clause is satisfied.\n3. Backtracking is involved when it encounters a conflict. This involves flipping the truth value of a previously made decision.\n4. This process of unit propagation, conflict-finding, and backtracking continues until either a conflict cannot be resolved thereby showing that the CNF is unsatisfiable, or all variables have been assigned a truth value which satisfies the CNF.\n\nFor example, let's consider the first clause, it has 2, -4, -3 so we can assign 2 = true, 4 = false, 3 = false.\n\nContinue this process for all clauses and go back (backtrack) when an assignment causes a later clause to fail.\n\nUsing an online SAT solver, we get the following solution:\n\nAnswer: \n\n1 = True\n2 = False\n3 = True\n4 = True\n5 = False"
