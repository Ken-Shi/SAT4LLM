To solve this SAT problem, we will use a SAT solver to determine if there exists an assignment of true or false values to the variables that satisfies all the clauses.

The DIMACS format specifies that we have 5 variables and 34 clauses. The variables are represented as integers from 1 to 5, and negations are represented by negative integers.

We will use a SAT solver to determine the solution.

Answer: This problem is unsatisfiable.
