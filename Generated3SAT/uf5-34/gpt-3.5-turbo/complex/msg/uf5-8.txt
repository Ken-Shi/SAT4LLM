To solve this SAT problem in DIMACS format, we will use a SAT solver. Here is the line of thoughts:

1. Pick a SAT solver (e.g., MiniSat, Glucose).
2. Convert the DIMACS format into a format compatible with the chosen solver.
3. Input the converted problem into the solver.
4. Check the output for satisfiability and extract the solution if it exists.

I will now use a SAT solver to find the solution.
