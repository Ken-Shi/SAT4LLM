We will use the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm to systematically search for a solution.\n\nStarting with an empty assignment, we will begin by selecting a variable and assigning it a truth value. In this case, we will start with variable 1 and assign it the value True.\n\nNext, we will propagate this assignment through the formula and update the clauses accordingly. For the clauses containing variable 1, we can simplify them:\n\nClause 1: -3 2 -1\nClause 2: -3 -1 4\n\nBy setting variable 1 to True, both clauses are now satisfied, and we can remove them from the formula.\n\nWe continue propagating these assignments through the formula until all clauses are satisfied or a conflict arises. After multiple iterations, we find that the formula is unsatisfiable.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \nanswer: UNSATISFIABLE"
