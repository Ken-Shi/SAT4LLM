                "content": "This problem is a Boolean satisfiability problem. Note that the first row \"p cnf 3 4\" is merely to declare the format, where \"p\" indicates that this is a problem, \"cnf\" specifies that this problem is in conjunctive normal form, \"3\" is the number of variables, and \"4\" is the number of clauses. The rest of the lines represent the clauses of the problem. Each clause is a disjunct of literals, with a \"0\" at the end of each clause to indicate its termination. A positive integer refers to the corresponding variable, while a negative integer refers to the negation of its absolute value. \n\nSo, let's interpret the lines: \n\n1. \"-1 -2 3 0\" can be read as \"NOT 1 OR NOT 2 OR 3\"\n2. \"-1 3 -2 0\" can be read as \"NOT 1 OR 3 OR NOT 2\"\n3. \"-2 -1 -3 0\" can be read as \"NOT 2 OR NOT 1 OR NOT 3\"\n4. \"-1 -3 -2 0\" can be read as \"NOT 1 OR NOT 3 OR NOT 2\"\n\nThe problem is to find variable mappings that make the entire expression true. \n\nSince all clauses contain \"NOT 1\", if we assign 1=False, then every clause will be satisfied no matter the other variables because \"NOT False = True\". \n\nFor the remainder variables, the two clauses \"-2 -1 -3 0\" and \"-1 -3 -2 0\" contain \"NOT 2\" and \"NOT 3\". If we assign 2=False and 3=False, it will make these clauses be evaluated to True. Specifically:\n\n- \"-1 -2 3 0\" would become \"True OR True OR False\"\n- \"-1 3 -2 0\" would become \"True OR False OR True\"\n- \"-2 -1 -3 0\" would become \"True OR True OR True\"\n- \"-1 -3 -2 0\" would become \"True OR True OR True\".\n\nIn all cases, each clause is true. Therefore, a solution set to satisfy this problem can be when variable 1 is False, variable 2 is False, and variable 3 is False.\n\nanswer: 1=False, 2=False, 3=False"
