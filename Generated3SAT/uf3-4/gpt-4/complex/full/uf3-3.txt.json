If we can find a combination of variables that makes all clauses true, then the SAT problem is solvable.\n\nOne possible way to satisfy all these clauses could be by setting x1 and x2 to be false(-1) and x3 to be true(1). This would make each clause true.\n\nAnswer: Mapping the values to x1 x2 x3, the solution would be x1 = -1, x2 = -1, and x3 = 1."
