                "content": "The DIMACS format is a way to represent Boolean expressions that are in conjunctive normal form (CNF). A CNF expression is an AND of ORs.\n\nThe preamble `p cnf 3 4` means that this is a CNF formula with 3 variables and 4 clauses. \n\nThe rest of the lines represent the clauses of the formula:\n\n3 -2 -1 0     --> (3 OR NOT 2 OR NOT 1)\n2 1 3 0       --> (2 OR 1 OR 3)\n2 3 1 0       --> (2 OR 3 OR 1)\n-2 3 1 0      --> (NOT 2 OR 3 OR 1)\n\nWe are looking for an assignment to the variables that makes the entire expression true. The variables can either be true (represented by themselves) or false (represented by a negative integer). \n\nTo solve it, we are going to assign initially all variables to True, and then through iterative inspection of the clauses, adjust the values as needed.\n\nInitial Assignment:\nVariable 1 => T\nVariable 2 => T\nVariable 3 => T\n\nFirst clause is (3 OR NOT 2 OR NOT 1), assign 2 and 1 to False to satisfy this clause.\n\nUpdated Assignment:\nVariable 1 => F\nVariable 2 => F\nVariable 3 => T\n\nFor the rest of clauses (2 OR 1 OR 3), (2 OR 3 OR 1), and (2 OR 3 OR 1), since we already have 3 to be True, they are already satisfied.\n\nFinal Assignment, written in DIMAC format:\nanswer: -1 -2 3"
