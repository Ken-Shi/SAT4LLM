                "content": "DIMACS is a standard format to represent Boolean SAT (satisfiability) problems. In this format, numbers represent variables and a negative number represents the negation of the variable. Each clause is a disjunction (an OR operation) where clauses are combined by an AND operation. Each line ends with a 0. \n\nThis problem can be translated to:\n(Not 2 or Not 3 or 1) AND\n(Not 1 or Not 3 or 2) AND\n(Not 1 or Not 3 or 2) AND\n(Not 2 or Not 3 or Not 1)\n\nOur requirement is to find a single allocation of variables (1, 2, and 3) that makes the entire expression true.\n\nWe can try for possible solutions. \n\nAssuming 1=True, 2=False, 3=False:\n1st clause is true since 2 and 3 are set to false\n2nd clause is false since 1 is set to true but 3 is set to false\n3rd clause is also false with the same reason as the 2nd.\n4th clause is true since 2 and 1 are not true\n\nSo this assignment cannot make the formula true.\n\nLet\u2019s try with 3=True.\n\nLet 1= False, 2= False, and 3= True:\n1st clause is true since 1 is True\n2nd clause is true since 2 is True\n3rd clause is true like the 2nd\n4th clause is false since 1, 2, and 3 are not all False\n\nSo, an assignment where 3=True isn't working either. \n\nNow, let's try setting all variables to False.\nSo, we have 1=False, 2=False, 3=False\nAll clauses are satisfied, so this is our solution\n\nanswer: 1=False, 2=False, 3=False"
