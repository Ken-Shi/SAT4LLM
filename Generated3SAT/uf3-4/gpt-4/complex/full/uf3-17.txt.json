                "content": "The given problem represents a conjunctive normal form in Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). It's a conjunction of 4 clauses where each clause is a disjunction of 3 literals.\n\n1. Breaking it down we have: \n  - (1 \u2228 2 \u2228 3)\n  - (2 \u2228 3 \u2228 1)\n  - (\u00ac1 \u2228 2 \u2228 3)\n  - (3 \u2228 1 \u2228 \u00ac2)\n\n2. To find an assignment that satisfies all these clauses, start by looking for a variable that can make each clause true:\n  - In the first clause, we can pick 1 to make the clause true. So 1 = True.\n  - The second & third clause also includes 1, but third clause has \u00ac1 which contradicts our choice in the first clause. So, we must consider \u00ac1 to satisfy the third clause. Now, 1 = False.\n  - The fourth clause can be satisfied by either 3 or \u00ac2. So, let 3 = True and 2 = False. \n\n3. The Boolean assignments that satisfy all clauses are: 1 = False, 2 = False, 3 = True.\n\nAnswer: 1 = False, 2 = False, 3 = True."
