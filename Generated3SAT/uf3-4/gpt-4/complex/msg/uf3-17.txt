The given problem represents a conjunctive normal form in Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). It's a conjunction of 4 clauses where each clause is a disjunction of 3 literals.

1. Breaking it down we have: 
  - (1 ? 2 ? 3)
  - (2 ? 3 ? 1)
  - (?1 ? 2 ? 3)
  - (3 ? 1 ? ?2)

2. To find an assignment that satisfies all these clauses, start by looking for a variable that can make each clause true:
  - In the first clause, we can pick 1 to make the clause true. So 1 = True.
  - The second & third clause also includes 1, but third clause has ?1 which contradicts our choice in the first clause. So, we must consider ?1 to satisfy the third clause. Now, 1 = False.
  - The fourth clause can be satisfied by either 3 or ?2. So, let 3 = True and 2 = False. 

3. The Boolean assignments that satisfy all clauses are: 1 = False, 2 = False, 3 = True.

Answer: 1 = False, 2 = False, 3 = True.
