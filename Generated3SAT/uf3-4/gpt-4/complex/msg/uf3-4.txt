This SAT problem is expressed in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), and its solution requires finding a set of boolean assignments for variables that satisfies all given clauses. 

It contains 3 variables (denoted as 1, 2, 3) and 4 clauses. The negative sign represents the negation of the variable. Each row represents a clause (a disjunction of literals) and the problem is the conjunction of these clauses. The "0" at the end of each line signals the end of a clause.

Let's try a systematic approach by going through the clauses and make any assignments that are directly enforceable. 

In the first clause (-3 -1 2 0), either -3, -1, or 2 has to be true. So either 3 is false, 1 is false, or 2 is true. Without information from other clauses, we cannot make a specific assignment yet.

Take the second clause (-2 -1 -3 0). For this clause to be true, at least one of the literals has to be true. So either 2 is false, 1 is false, or 3 is false. But again, this doesn't give us a definitive assignment.

The third clause (2 -3 -1 0) imples 2 is true, 1 is false, or 2 is false.

In the last clause (-3 -1 2 0), again either 3 is false, 1 is false, or 2 is true. This repeats the first clause, so it doesn't provide any new information.

It seems like there is no definite assignment can be directly inferred from the clauses individually. Let's try factoring in the fact that all of the clauses have to be true together.

Consider variables one by one: 

1. For the variable 1, we have it in two forms in clauses: -1 and -1 which means not true (false), therefore we will have 1 set to False.

2. For variable 2, we again have it in two forms: -2 and 2. Thus, there's a conflict and no simple resolution, so we can't simply assign it as true or false right off the bat.

3. For variable 3, we have it in one form across all clauses: -3, which translates to 3 being false.

This means out of three variables we know for sure about two: variable 1 and variable 3 are False. We don't know what variable 2 is for certain, or whether or not it can actually satisfy the entire SAT expression, but we can try possible assignments to see which, if any, results in all clauses being satisfied.

1. Try True for variable 2. If this is the case, every clause would be satisfied. Thus, this is a valid assignment.

Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem, in terms of boolean assignments that satisfy all clauses is:

answer: {1=False, 2=True, 3=False}
