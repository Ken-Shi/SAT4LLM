This is a problem of Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem. We have three variables (that's what `p cnf 3 4` means - 3 variables and 4 clauses) and we have to find an assignment of TRUE or FALSE to each variable such that every clause is satisfied. A clause is satisfied if at least one of its literals is true. 

Here's the problem in a more human-readable format:

1. ?x1 or x3 or x2
2. x2 or ?x3 or x1
3. x1 or ?x2 or ?x3
4. ?x1 or ?x2 or x3

The current problem is in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), which means that it consists of the conjunction (AND) of several clauses, where each clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals (variables or their negation). 

Now, let's try to solve it:

1. We first look at the first clause `?x1 or x3 or x2`. This cannot give us definite information about the variables, so let's move on.

2. The second clause `x2 or ?x3 or x1`, similarly does not help.

3. The third clause `x1 or ?x2 or ?x3`. If we assume that x1 is false, then both x2 and x3 should be false. But this immediately contradicts with the first clause where we need either x2 or x3 (or both) to be true (in case when x1 is false) to satisfy that clause.

   This means our assumption that x1 is false is wrong. So, x1 must be true.

4. Knowing that x1 is true, we can satisfy the first clause `?x1 or x3 or x2` already.

5. To satisfy the second clause `x2 or ?x3 or x1`, x1 being true is also enough.

6. For the third clause `x1 or ?x2 or ?x3`, x1 being true is enough too. 

7. Lastly for the fourth clause ` ?x1 or ?x2 or x3`, we need either x2 to be false or x3 to be true (or both). Let's assume that x2 is false. 

Then we can check again, and it turns out these set of truth values for the variables (x1=true, x2=false, x3 can be either false or true) satisfy all four clauses.

So, a possible solution is:

Answer: x1=1, x2=0, x3=0 or x1=1, x2=0, x3=1
