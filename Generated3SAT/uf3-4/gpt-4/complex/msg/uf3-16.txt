To solve this, we need to find values for _1, _2, and _3 such that each of the clauses given are satisfied. A clause is satisfied if at least one of the variables in the clause has a value that makes the clause true.

Here is how we'll approach it:

1. For the first clause, we have -1 -3 2. This clause is true if either _1 is False, _3 is False, or _2 is True. So we have 3 possible solutions here.

2. For the second clause, we have 1 2 -3 which means the clause is true if either _1 is True, _2 is True, or _3 is False. The value of _2 being True from the first clause satisfies this clause as well, but there are other possible solutions.

3. The third clause is the same as first clause and hence will have the same possible solutions.

4. The fourth clause is same as the second clause and will have the same possible solutions.

A working solution here could be one where _2=True (which satisfies all clauses) and any values can be assigned to _1 and _3 as they are not affecting the result.

answer: {_1=any, _2=True, _3=any}
