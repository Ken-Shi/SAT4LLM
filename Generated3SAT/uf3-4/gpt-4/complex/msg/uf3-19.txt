The provided problem is a SAT problem, particularly a 3-SAT problem as it involves three literals (3, 2, and 1) and is encoded in the DIMACS format.

DIMACS format is a standard for writing boolean satisfiability problems, with each number representing a literal, and each line until the 0 representing a clause in the formula. The leading 'p cnf 3 4' line suggests that the problem is in conjunctive normal form (cnf) with 3 variables and 4 clauses. 

Now let's break down each line and see what they correspond to:

- The first clause (-3 1 -2 0) represents the disjunction (NOT C OR A OR NOT B)
- The second clause (-3 -2 -1 0) represents the disjunction (NOT C OR NOT B OR NOT A)
- The third clause (-3 1 -2 0) represents again the disjunction (NOT C OR A OR NOT B)
- The fourth clause (1 -2 -3 0) represents the disjunction (A OR NOT B OR NOT C)

To find a solution, we need to assign the values to the literals (A, B, C) that make the overall expression true.

First, we need to note that all clauses either have NOT C or NOT B, and also there are clauses including both NOT C and NOT B. This gives us the hint that, at least one of them should be true, C = False or B = False, to make all these disjunction clauses to be true. 

To decide each of them, let's look clause by clause:

- Assign A = True, B = False, C = False, all clauses are satisfied. In the first, second and third clause, NOT C = True satisfies all those. And in the last clause, A = True makes the clause true. 

Answer: A = True, B = False, C = False
