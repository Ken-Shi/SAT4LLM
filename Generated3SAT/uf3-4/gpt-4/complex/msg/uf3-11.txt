Line of thoughts:

The SAT problem in DIMACS format represents a constraint satisfaction problem. In this format, variables are denoted by positive integers, negation is denoted using the minus sign and clauses are denoted by listing the numbers of the variables in that clause. The "0" at the end of a line represents the end of a clause.

Given the problem:
```
p cnf 3 4
1 -3 -2 0
1 -3 -2 0
-2 -3 1 0
-3 -2 1 0
```

This SAT problem tells us:
- There are 3 variables (1, 2, 3)
- There are 4 clauses (1 -3 -2, 1 -3 -2, -2 -3 1, -3 -2 1)

The execution of the clauses (reading the numbers as logic propositions) would be:

1st clause: (1 AND NOT 3 AND NOT 2)
2nd clause: (1 AND NOT 3 AND NOT 2)
3rd clause: (NOT 2 AND NOT 3 AND 1)
4th clause: (NOT 3 AND NOT 2 AND 1)

The redundancy of the clauses can be reduced by combining the conditions. Notice here that the first two clauses are identical, and the last two clauses are identical. So for simplification purposes, they can be reduced to:

1 -3 -2 0
-2 -3 1 0

As logical conditions, this becomes:

(1 AND NOT 3 AND NOT 2)
(NOT 2 AND NOT 3 AND 1)

To satisfy these conditions, 1 must be true (since it is not negated in any clause) while 2 and 3 must both be false (since they are both negated). 

Answer: So the solution to the given SAT problem should be 1=True, 2=False, 3=False.
