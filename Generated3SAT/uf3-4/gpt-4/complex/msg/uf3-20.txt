To solve this SAT (Satisfiability) problem, we first need to understand the DIMACS format. It's used to represent Boolean satisfiability problems. The "p cnf 3 4" line stands for "problem: conjunctive normal form, with 3 variables and 4 clauses". Each of the following lines represents a clause, and the numbers represent literals (positive or negative of the variables).

The 4 clauses given in the problem corresponds to:

(3 OR NOT 2 OR 1)
(NOT 3 OR NOT 2 OR 1)
(1 OR 3 OR 2)
(3 OR 1 OR 2)

Each clause is a disjunctive clause which means if any single literal in the clause is true, then the clause is true. The whole problem is a conjunctive clause implying all clauses must be true for the formula to be true.

Let's start to solve this problem by giving possible true or false to each value:

Let's trial with variable assignment:
1=true, 
2=true,
3=true

Substitute these values into our statements:

(3 OR NOT 2 OR 1)
(true OR NOT true OR true) = true, because an OR clause is true if one constituent is true. 

(NOT 3 OR NOT 2 OR 1)
(NOT true OR NOT true OR true) = true, because true is part of the OR clause. 

(1 OR 3 OR 2)
(true OR true OR true) = true, because true is part of the OR clause.

(3 OR 1 OR 2)
(true OR true OR true) = true, because true is part of the OR clause. 

Since all disjunctive clauses are true, the conjunctive clause (the entire problem) is also true. 

answer: 
Variable assignment:
1=true, 
2=true,
3=true
