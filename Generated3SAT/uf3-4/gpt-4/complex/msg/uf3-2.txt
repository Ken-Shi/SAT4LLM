DIMACS is a standard format to represent Boolean SAT (satisfiability) problems. In this format, numbers represent variables and a negative number represents the negation of the variable. Each clause is a disjunction (an OR operation) where clauses are combined by an AND operation. Each line ends with a 0. 

This problem can be translated to:
(Not 2 or Not 3 or 1) AND
(Not 1 or Not 3 or 2) AND
(Not 1 or Not 3 or 2) AND
(Not 2 or Not 3 or Not 1)

Our requirement is to find a single allocation of variables (1, 2, and 3) that makes the entire expression true.

We can try for possible solutions. 

Assuming 1=True, 2=False, 3=False:
1st clause is true since 2 and 3 are set to false
2nd clause is false since 1 is set to true but 3 is set to false
3rd clause is also false with the same reason as the 2nd.
4th clause is true since 2 and 1 are not true

So this assignment cannot make the formula true.

Let?s try with 3=True.

Let 1= False, 2= False, and 3= True:
1st clause is true since 1 is True
2nd clause is true since 2 is True
3rd clause is true like the 2nd
4th clause is false since 1, 2, and 3 are not all False

So, an assignment where 3=True isn't working either. 

Now, let's try setting all variables to False.
So, we have 1=False, 2=False, 3=False
All clauses are satisfied, so this is our solution

answer: 1=False, 2=False, 3=False
