The DIMACS format is a way to represent Boolean expressions that are in conjunctive normal form (CNF). A CNF expression is an AND of ORs.

The preamble `p cnf 3 4` means that this is a CNF formula with 3 variables and 4 clauses. 

The rest of the lines represent the clauses of the formula:

3 -2 -1 0     --> (3 OR NOT 2 OR NOT 1)
2 1 3 0       --> (2 OR 1 OR 3)
2 3 1 0       --> (2 OR 3 OR 1)
-2 3 1 0      --> (NOT 2 OR 3 OR 1)

We are looking for an assignment to the variables that makes the entire expression true. The variables can either be true (represented by themselves) or false (represented by a negative integer). 

To solve it, we are going to assign initially all variables to True, and then through iterative inspection of the clauses, adjust the values as needed.

Initial Assignment:
Variable 1 => T
Variable 2 => T
Variable 3 => T

First clause is (3 OR NOT 2 OR NOT 1), assign 2 and 1 to False to satisfy this clause.

Updated Assignment:
Variable 1 => F
Variable 2 => F
Variable 3 => T

For the rest of clauses (2 OR 1 OR 3), (2 OR 3 OR 1), and (2 OR 3 OR 1), since we already have 3 to be True, they are already satisfied.

Final Assignment, written in DIMAC format:
answer: -1 -2 3
