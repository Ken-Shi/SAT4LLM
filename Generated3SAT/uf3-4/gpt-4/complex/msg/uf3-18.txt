This problem is a Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) represented in the DIMACS format. The DIMACS is a common text format for specifying these kinds of problems. 

In the DIMACS format:
- The first line provides information about the problem. In this case, it states "p cnf 3 4", which means:
  - "p" - indicates that this line provides problem parameters
  - "cnf" - represents that the problem is in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).
  - "3" - indicates the highest integer in the file representing a variable (i.e there are 3 variables in the problem namely 1, 2 and 3).
  - "4" - signifies how many clauses or rules there are (i.e., there are 4 clauses in this problem).
  
- The following lines represent the logical clauses where 
  - Positive integers represent the positive literals 
  - Negative integers represent the negation of the literals
  - "0" at the end of each line is used to denote the end of each clause.

Now, to solve this problem, we try to find an assignment of the variables that make the entire formula true. If we can't find such an assignment then the formula is unsatisfiable.

Based on the above, we interpret each clause as:

- not 3 OR not 1 OR not 2
- Not 1 OR not 2 OR 3
- Not 2 OR 3 OR 1
- Not 2 OR 3 OR not 1

Note: We will use true = 1 and false = -1

Now, we need to find a solution that satisfies all clauses. By analyzing the clauses, an observation we can make is that either 3 or not 3 is in every clause hence 3 can be true (or 1 in our case). The clauses thus become: 

- Not 1 OR not 2 OR true
- Not 1 OR not 2 OR true
- Not 2 OR true OR 1
- Not 2 OR true OR not 1

As we can see, each clause is now true since it contains at least one true literal.

Answer: So, one solution could be {3 = true, 1 = false, 2 = false} or in other encoded form {3 = 1, 1 = -1, 2 = -1}.
