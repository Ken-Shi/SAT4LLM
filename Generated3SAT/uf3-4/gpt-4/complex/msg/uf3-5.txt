This problem is asking to solve a Boolean Satisfiability problem, encoded in the DIMACS format used for specifying instances of this problem. This is the task of finding any possible set of true/false values assigned to the boolean variables (in this case 1, 2, and 3) that make the entire expression true. 

Here's how the clauses are translated from DIMACS:

1. 3 OR 1 OR 2 
2. 1 OR 2 OR NOT 3 
3. NOT 2 OR 1 OR 3
4. NOT 1 OR 3 OR 2

The expression is true if all clauses are true. A clause is true if any of its variables is true (for positive literals) or false (for negated literals).

Now let's try to find an assignment:

1. Since first and second clause contain all literals as positive, we can set at least one of them to true. Let?s set 1 to true. 

2. Since third clause contains 2 as negative, to make the clause true we can set 2 to false. 

3. With these settings of 1 and 2, the fourth clause is already true. 

The only variable that hasn?t been set yet and is not impacted by this set of variables and their values is 3. We can freely choose a value for 3, so let's set it to true.

So the initial assignment that satisfies the formula is 1=true, 2=false, 3=true.

Answer: (1=true, 2=false, 3=true)
