To solve this problem, we will use the following encoding in DIMACS format:

p cnf 3 4  
-1 3 2 0  
3 -1 -2 0  
-1 3 -2 0  
-2 -3 -1 0  

We are given 3 variables and 4 clauses.

Now, we will look at each clause:

1) Clause 1: -1 3 2  
This clause can be satisfied by setting variables 1 and 3 to true.

2) Clause 2: 3 -1 -2  
This clause can also be satisfied by setting variables 1 and 3 to true.

3) Clause 3: -1 3 -2  
This clause can be satisfied by setting variables 1 and 3 to true.

4) Clause 4: -2 -3 -1  
This clause can be satisfied by setting variables 1 and 2 to false, and variable 3 to true.

Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:

answer: 1 0 1
