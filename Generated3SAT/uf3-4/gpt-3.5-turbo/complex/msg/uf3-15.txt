To solve this problem, we must convert the DIMACS format into a more readable format. The clauses given are:
1. (-1 OR -2 OR 3)
2. (-1 OR 3 OR -2)
3. (-2 OR -1 OR -3)
4. (-1 OR -3 OR -2)

We can then try all possible combinations of truth values for variables 1, 2, and 3 to see if any combination satisfies all clauses.

1. Set all variables to False: -1, -2, -3
   None of the clauses are satisfied, move on to the next combination.

2. Set variable 1 to True: 1, -2, 3
   Clauses 1 and 2 are satisfied, but clauses 3 and 4 are not. Move on to the next combination.

3. Set variable 2 to True: -1, 2, 3
   Clauses 1 and 2 are satisfied, but clauses 3 and 4 are not. Move on to the next combination.

4. Set variable 3 to True: -1, -2, 3
   Clauses 1 and 2 are satisfied, but clauses 3 and 4 are not. Move on to the next combination.

5. Set variables 1 and 2 to True: 1, 2, 3
   Clauses 1, 2, and 3 are satisfied, but clause 4 is not. Move on to the next combination.

6. Set variables 1 and 3 to True: 1, -2, 3
   Clauses 1, 2, and 4 are satisfied, but clause 3 is not. Move on to the next combination.

7. Set variables 2 and 3 to True: -1, 2, 3
   Clauses 1, 2, and 4 are satisfied, but clause 3 is not. Move on to the next combination.

8. Set all variables to True: 1, 2, 3
   Clauses 1, 2, and 3 are satisfied, but clause 4 is not.

After trying all possible combinations, we see that there is no assignment of truth values that satisfies all clauses. Therefore, the problem is unsatisfiable.

answer: unsatisfiable
