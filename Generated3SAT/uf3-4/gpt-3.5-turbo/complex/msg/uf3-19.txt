To solve this SAT problem, we convert the DIMACS format into clauses:

Clause 1: (-3 or 1 or -2)
Clause 2: (-3 or -2 or -1)
Clause 3: (-3 or 1 or -2)
Clause 4: (1 or -2 or -3)

To check if these clauses are satisfiable, we can try to assign truth values to the literals and see if we can make all the clauses true.

Let's start with:
1 = True
2 = False
3 = False

Then we can see that:
-3 or 1 or -2 is true (1)
-3 or -2 or -1 is false (0)
-3 or 1 or -2 is true (1)
1 or -2 or -3 is true (1)

Therefore, the assignment 1=True, 2=False, 3=False satisfies all the clauses.

answer: 1=True, 2=False, 3=False
