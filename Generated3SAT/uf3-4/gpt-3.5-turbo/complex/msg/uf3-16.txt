To solve this SAT problem, we will use the DIMACS format provided:

p cnf 3 4
-1 -3 2 0
1 2 -3 0
-1 -3 2 0
-1 2 -3 0

From the DIMACS format:
- There are 3 variables (1, 2, 3) and 4 clauses.
- Each clause is separated by a space, with a 0 at the end indicating the end of the clause.

Now, we will convert the clauses into a more readable format:
1. (?1 ? ?3 ? 2)
2. (1 ? 2 ? ?3)
3. (?1 ? ?3 ? 2)
4. (?1 ? 2 ? ?3)

Now, we will try to find a satisfying assignment for the clauses:
- Let's try assigning each variable to True (T) or False (F) and see if the clauses are satisfied.

1. For (T, F, T):
    Clause 1: (-1 -1 2) = True
    Clause 2: (1 2 -1) = True
    Clause 3: (-1 -1 2) = True
    Clause 4: (-1 2 -1) = True
    
This assignment satisfies all the clauses, so the answer is:
answer: 1 0 -1
