To solve this SAT problem, we need to first convert the given CNF formula into a more readable form:

(1 ? 2 ? ?3)
(2 ? ?1 ? ?3)
(?1 ? 2 ? ?3)
(2 ? ?3 ? ?1)

Next, we can consider each clause individually and try to satisfy all of them. 

1st clause: (1 ? 2 ? ?3)
To satisfy this clause, we can set:
- 1 = True
- 2 = True
- 3 = False

2nd clause: (2 ? ?1 ? ?3)
Since we have already set 1 and 2 to True in the previous clause, this clause is automatically satisfied.

3rd clause: (?1 ? 2 ? ?3)
This clause is also satisfied with the previous assignments.

4th clause: (2 ? ?3 ? ?1)
Same as the 2nd clause, this is automatically satisfied with the current assignments.

Therefore, the solution is:
1 = True
2 = True
3 = False

answer: 1 2 -3
