To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to convert the clauses into logical expressions and determine if there is a satisfying assignment. 

The DIMACS format is as follows:
p cnf 3 4
-1 3 2 0
3 -1 2 0
3 -1 -2 0
2 -3 -1 0

Let's convert each clause into logical expressions:

(?x1 ? x3 ? x2)
(x3 ? ?x1 ? x2)
(x3 ? ?x1 ? ?x2)
(x2 ? ?x3 ? ?x1)

Now, we need to determine if there is a satisfying assignment for these expressions. We can use the following line of reasoning:

1. Combine all the expressions:
(?x1 ? x3 ? x2) ? (x3 ? ?x1 ? x2) ? (x3 ? ?x1 ? ?x2) ? (x2 ? ?x3 ? ?x1)

2. Try to find a satisfying assignment:
- Let's try setting x1 = True, x2 = False, x3 = True:
(?True ? True ? False) ? (True ? ?True ? False) ? (True ? ?True ? ?False) ? (False ? ?True ? ?True)
(False ? True ? False) ? (True ? False ? False) ? (True ? False ? True) ? (False ? False ? False)
True ? True ? True ? False
Since the last part is False, this assignment doesn't satisfy all the expressions.

Therefore, there is no satisfying assignment for the given expressions.

answer: There is no satisfying assignment.
