To solve this problem, we will first convert the DIMACS format into a more readable format where each clause is represented as a list of integers. 

The DIMACS format given is:
p cnf 3 4
-3 -2 -1 0
3 -1 2 0
1 -2 -3 0
-2 -1 3 0

Converting this into a readable format:
[-3, -2, -1]
[3, -1, 2]
[1, -2, -3]
[-2, -1, 3]

Now, we will assign truth values to the variables present in the clauses in order to satisfy all clauses. Let's start with variable 1 being True, variable 2 being False, and variable 3 being True.

Plugging these values into the clauses:
[-3, -2, -1] => [False, True, True] => False
[3, -1, 2] => [True, True, False] => False
[1, -2, -3] => [True, False, False] => False
[-2, -1, 3] => [False, True, True] => False

Since none of the clauses are satisfied with the given truth assignment, we try a different set of truth values. Let's try variable 1 being False, variable 2 being True, and variable 3 being True.

Plugging these values into the clauses:
[-3, -2, -1] => [False, True, False] => False
[3, -1, 2] => [True, False, True] => False
[1, -2, -3] => [False, True, False] => False
[-2, -1, 3] => [True, False, True] => False

Since none of the clauses are satisfied with this truth assignment as well, we try another set of truth values. Let's try variable 1 being True, variable 2 being True, and variable 3 being True.

Plugging these values into the clauses:
[-3, -2, -1] => [False, False, True] => False
[3, -1, 2] => [True, False, True] => False
[1, -2, -3] => [True, False, False] => False
[-2, -1, 3] => [False, False, True] => False

None of the truth assignments satisfy all the clauses, hence the given SAT problem is unsatisfiable.

answer: The given SAT problem is unsatisfiable.
