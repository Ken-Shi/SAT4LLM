To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to first analyze the clauses provided:

1. Clause 1: 3 -2 -1 - This can be interpreted as (?3 OR 2 OR 1)
2. Clause 2: 2 1 3 - This can be interpreted as (2 OR 1 OR 3)
3. Clause 3: 2 3 1 - This can be interpreted as (2 OR 3 OR 1)
4. Clause 4: -2 3 1 - This can be interpreted as (?2 OR 3 OR 1)

Based on the above clauses, we can see a common pattern that variable 1 must be true in order for clauses 1, 2, and 3 to be satisfied. Additionally, variable 3 must be true for clauses 1, 2, and 4 to be satisfied.

Therefore, the satisfying assignment for this SAT problem would be:
1: True
2: False
3: True

This assignment satisfies all the clauses. 

answer: 1 -2 3
