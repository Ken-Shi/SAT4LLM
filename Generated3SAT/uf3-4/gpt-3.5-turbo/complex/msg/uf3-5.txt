To solve this SAT problem, we need to convert the DIMACS format into a logical expression:

(1) (3 OR 1 OR 2)
(2) (1 OR 2 OR NOT 3)
(3) (NOT 2 OR 1 OR 3)
(4) (NOT 1 OR 3 OR 2)

Now, let's try to simplify the logical expression:

From (1), we see that we need either 3, 1, or 2 to be true.
From (2), if 3 is false (NOT 3), then either 1 or 2 must be true.
From (3), if 2 is false (NOT 2), then 1 and 3 must be true.
From (4), if 1 is false (NOT 1), then 3 and 2 must be true.

Since we have contradictions in our simplified logical expression, this SAT problem is unsatisfiable.

answer: unsatisfiable
