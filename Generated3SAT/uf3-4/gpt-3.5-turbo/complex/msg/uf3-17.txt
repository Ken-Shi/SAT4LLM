To solve this problem, we can convert the DIMACS format CNF clauses into logical expressions:

(1 OR 2 OR 3)
(2 OR 3 OR 1)
(NOT 1 OR 2 OR 3)
(3 OR 1 OR NOT 2)

Now, we can derive the truth values that satisfy all these expressions by trial and error.

From the first clause, it's evident that either 1, 2, or 3 must be true. Let's try setting all variables as true to see if it satisfies the other clauses:
1 = true
2 = true
3 = true

Checking against the other clauses:
(2 OR 3 OR 1) - satisfied
(NOT 1 OR 2 OR 3) - satisfied
(3 OR 1 OR NOT 2) - satisfied

Therefore, the solution that satisfies all the clauses is:
1 = true
2 = true
3 = true

answer: 1 2 3
