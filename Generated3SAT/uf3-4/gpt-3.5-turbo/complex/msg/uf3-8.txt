To solve this SAT problem, we need to first convert the problem given in DIMACS format to a logical formula.

The DIMACS format:
p cnf 3 4
-1 3 2 0
2 -3 1 0
1 -2 -3 0
-1 -2 3 0

can be translated into the following logical formula:
(-1 ? 3 ? 2) ? (2 ? -3 ? 1) ? (1 ? -2 ? -3) ? (-1 ? -2 ? 3)

We can then analyze the formula to determine if it is satisfiable. We can create a truth table or use logical reasoning to find a solution. 

Looking at the formula, we can see that any assignment that makes the third clause true will also make the formula true. Let's assign true to variable 1, false to variable 2, and true to variable 3.

Therefore, the satisfiable assignment is:
1 = True
2 = False
3 = True

answer: 1 -2 3
