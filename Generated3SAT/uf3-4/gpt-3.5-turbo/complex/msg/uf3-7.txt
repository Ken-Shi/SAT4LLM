To solve this SAT problem, we can convert the given problem in DIMACS format into a system of logical constraints:

1. (1 OR NOT 2 OR NOT 3)
2. (NOT 1 OR 2 OR NOT 3)
3. (2 OR 3 OR 1)
4. (3 OR NOT 2 OR 1)

Now, we can try to find a set of truth values for the variables that satisfy all four constraints. We can start by trying to assign truth values to the variables in order. Let's consider the following assignments:

1. Assigning true to variable 1, false to variable 2, and false to variable 3:
   - Constraint 1: (true OR true OR true) -> (true) -> Satisfied
   - Constraint 2: (false OR false OR true) -> (true) -> Satisfied
   - Constraint 3: (false OR false OR true) -> (true) -> Satisfied
   - Constraint 4: (false OR true OR true) -> (true) -> Satisfied
   
Therefore, the assignment of true to variable 1, false to variable 2, and false to variable 3 satisfies all constraints. 

Final answer:
answer: 1 -2 -3
