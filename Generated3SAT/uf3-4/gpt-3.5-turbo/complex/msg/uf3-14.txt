To solve this SAT problem, let's first interpret the given SAT problem in DIMACS format:
- There are 3 variables (1, 2, 3) and 4 clauses.
- The first clause is 2 -1 3 0, which translates to (2 OR NOT 1 OR 3)
- The second clause is 3 1 2 0, which translates to (3 OR 1 OR 2)
- The third clause is 2 1 3 0, which translates to (2 OR 1 OR 3)
- The fourth clause is -1 2 3 0, which translates to (NOT 1 OR 2 OR 3)

Now, we will try to find an assignment that satisfies all the clauses. 

Let's start with an initial assignment of (1 = true, 2 = false, 3 = true):

- For the first clause (2 OR NOT 1 OR 3):
2 OR (NOT 1) OR 3
false OR (NOT true) OR true
false OR false OR true = true

- For the second clause (3 OR 1 OR 2):
3 OR 1 OR 2
true OR true OR false = true

- For the third clause (2 OR 1 OR 3):
2 OR 1 OR 3
false OR true OR true = true

- For the fourth clause (NOT 1 OR 2 OR 3):
(NOT 1) OR 2 OR 3
false OR false OR true = true

Since all clauses are satisfied with this assignment, the solution is:

answer: 1 -2 3
