Given a DIMACS-encoded SAT problem, we can extract the clauses in CNF format:
1. (-2 -3 1)
2. (-1 -3 2)
3. (-1 -3 2)
4. (-2 -3 -1)

To solve this SAT problem, we can apply the following method:
1. Start with an empty assignment of truth values to variables.
2. Choose one clause and assign truth values to variables in a way that makes the clause true.
3. Repeat step 2 for the remaining clauses, making sure to maintain the truth values assigned in previous steps.

Let's go through the clauses one by one:
1. We can set variable 1 = True, because if 2 and 3 are False, the clause will be True.
2. We can set variable 1 = False and variable 2 = True, because if 3 is False, the clause will be True.
3. Since the second and third clauses are identical, we already satisfied them by setting variable 1 = False and variable 2 = True.
4. We can set variable 1 = False, variable 2 = False, and variable 3 = True, because if 2 is False, the clause will be True.

Thus, the solution to this SAT problem is:
answer: 011
