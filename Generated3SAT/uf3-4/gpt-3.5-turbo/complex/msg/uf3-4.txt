To solve this SAT problem, we will first convert the DIMACS format into a more readable format.

The given SAT problem can be represented as:
1. (~c v ~a v b)
2. (~b v ~a v ~c)
3. (b v ~c v a)
4. (~c v ~a v b)

This problem has 3 variables (a, b, c) and 4 clauses.

To solve this problem, we will apply the following steps:

Step 1: Eliminate duplicate clauses.
Step 2: Simplify each clause
Step 3: Assign truth values to simplify the clauses
Step 4: Determine if the problem is satisfiable or unsatisfiable

1. (~c v ~a v b)
2. (~b v ~a v ~c)
3. (b v ~c v a)

Step 1: No duplicate clauses are present.

Step 2:
Clause 1: ~c v ~a v b => c = F, a = F, b = T => (T v T v F) => T
Clause 2: ~b v ~a v ~c => b = F, a = F, c = F => (T v T v T) => T
Clause 3: b v ~c v a => b = T, c = F, a = T => (T v T v T) => T

Since all 3 clauses simplify to True, the problem is satisfiable.

Therefore, the answer is:
answer: Satisfiable
