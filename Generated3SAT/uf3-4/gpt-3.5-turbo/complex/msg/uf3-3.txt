To solve this SAT problem, we will first assign variables to each number in the DIMACS format. Let's say variable 1 represents number 1, variable 2 represents number 2, and variable 3 represents number 3.

The clauses can be interpreted as follows:
1. (3 OR ?1 OR ?2)
2. (?2 OR ?1 OR ?3)
3. (?3 OR ?2 OR ?1)
4. (3 OR ?1 OR ?2)

Now, we will try to satisfy these clauses one by one:
- If we set variable 1 as true, then clauses 1, 2, and 4 are satisfied.
- If we set variable 2 as false, then clauses 1, 2, and 3 are satisfied.
- If we set variable 3 as true, then clauses 1 and 4 are satisfied.

Therefore, the assignment of variables that satisfies all the clauses is:
1. Variable 1 is true
2. Variable 2 is false
3. Variable 3 is true

answer: 1 -2 3
