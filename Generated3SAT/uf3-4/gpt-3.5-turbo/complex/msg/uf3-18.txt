To solve this problem, we will first list out the clauses in the CNF form:

1. (-3 OR -1 OR -2)
2. (-1 OR -2 OR 3)
3. (-2 OR 3 OR 1)
4. (-2 OR 3 OR -1)

Now, we can try to simplify the problem by examining which variables must be true in order for all the clauses to be satisfied.

From clause 3, we know that at least one of -2, 3, or 1 must be true. But if -2 were true, then clause 1 would be false. Thus, either 3 or 1 must be true. 

From the simplification above, we can conclude that the only assignment that satisfies all the clauses is:
- Variable 3 is true
- Variable 1 is true
- Variable 2 is false

Therefore, the solution to the SAT problem is:
answer: 3 1 -2
