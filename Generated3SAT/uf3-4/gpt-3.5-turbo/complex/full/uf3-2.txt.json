(-2 -3 -1)\n\nTo solve this SAT problem, we can apply the following method:\n1. Start with an empty assignment of truth values to variables.\n2. Choose one clause and assign truth values to variables in a way that makes the clause true.\n3. Repeat step 2 for the remaining clauses, making sure to maintain the truth values assigned in previous steps.\n\nLet's go through the clauses one by one:\n1. We can set variable 1 = True, because if 2 and 3 are False, the clause will be True.\n2. We can set variable 1 = False and variable 2 = True, because if 3 is False, the clause will be True.\n3. Since the second and third clauses are identical, we already satisfied them by setting variable 1 = False and variable 2 = True.\n4. We can set variable 1 = False, variable 2 = False, and variable 3 = True, because if 2 is False, the clause will be True.\n\nThus, the solution to this SAT problem is:\nanswer: 011"
