Let's say variable 1 represents number 1, variable 2 represents number 2, and variable 3 represents number 3.\n\nThe clauses can be interpreted as follows:\n1. (3 OR \u00ac1 OR \u00ac2)\n2. (\u00ac2 OR \u00ac1 OR \u00ac3)\n3. (\u00ac3 OR \u00ac2 OR \u00ac1)\n4. (3 OR \u00ac1 OR \u00ac2)\n\nNow, we will try to satisfy these clauses one by one:\n- If we set variable 1 as true, then clauses 1, 2, and 4 are satisfied.\n- If we set variable 2 as false, then clauses 1, 2, and 3 are satisfied.\n- If we set variable 3 as true, then clauses 1 and 4 are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the assignment of variables that satisfies all the clauses is:\n1. Variable 1 is true\n2. Variable 2 is false\n3. Variable 3 is true\n\nanswer: 1 -2 3"
