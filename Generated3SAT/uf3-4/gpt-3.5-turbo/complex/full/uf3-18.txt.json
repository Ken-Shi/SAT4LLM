(-2 OR 3 OR -1)\n\nNow, we can try to simplify the problem by examining which variables must be true in order for all the clauses to be satisfied.\n\nFrom clause 3, we know that at least one of -2, 3, or 1 must be true. But if -2 were true, then clause 1 would be false. Thus, either 3 or 1 must be true. \n\nFrom the simplification above, we can conclude that the only assignment that satisfies all the clauses is:\n- Variable 3 is true\n- Variable 1 is true\n- Variable 2 is false\n\nTherefore, the solution to the SAT problem is:\nanswer: 3 1 -2"
