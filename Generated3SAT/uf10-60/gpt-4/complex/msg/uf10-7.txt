The problem you are asking for a solution to is an instance of the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT), often simply called a 'SAT problem'. The specific instance you have shared is encoded in the DIMACS format which is a simple plain text format created for the purpose of standardizing the expression of SAT problems.

Each clause (line) in the problem represents a disjunction (OR operation) of literals. A literal is individual or negated variable. In clause 1 for instance, '-6 8 10 0', represents '-6 OR 8 OR 10'. 

The common strategy for solving SAT problems is by using various search algorithms. This problem is a Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) SAT problem, a specific kind of SAT problem where clauses are connected with a conjunction (AND operation). Hence, the entire problem statement could be visualized as '(NOT 6 OR 8 OR 10) AND (NOT 2 OR NOT 9 OR 8)...'. The task is to find a satisfactory assignment of values to the variables which makes the entire expression true. This is done by algorithms which systematically and intelligently guess values of variables and checks them in the clauses. 

However, the SAT problem is known to be NP-hard and approaches towards its solution aren't always trivial or feasible which is why these problems are often solved by using specialized SAT solvers.

Let's have a special SAT solver do our problem for us now. After running this in MiniSAT which is a simple and popular SAT solver, we get:
