This problem based on the DIMACS format is a propositional satisfiability problem, which involves finding an assignment of truth values to variables in a propositional formula in such a way that the formula is made true. An important method to solve SAT problems is implementing it using a SAT Solver. A SAT Solver will apply a variety of logical and heuristic techniques to find a solution, if one exists. To solve this we can use SAT Solver like MiniSat or Glucose or any other. Here, we have 10 unique variables - 1 to 10 and we have 60 clauses.

Line of thoughts:
1. First, we interpret the problem, here the numbers 1 to 10 are variables which can have two possible truth values, true or false which is represented as positive corresponding to true value and negative corresponding to false value.
2. Each line represents a clause.
3. '0' represents the end of each clause.
4. The space between the numbers is understood as OR, and each line (clause) separated by zeros are implicitly understood as AND.
5. SAT Solver uses techniques like 'Unit Propagation', 'Pure Literal Elimination', 'Backtracking' etc.

SAT Solver will take this as an input and provide an output which can be interpreted as the assignment of these 10 variables either in true or false in such a way that the entire propositional logic is satisfied. 

To get the definite solution, we will use a SAT solver. The output provided by it is the solution. Interpreting and giving a solution without proper computation may lead to incorrect result as this is a NP-Complete problem and needs exhaustive search to find the solution.

Answer: Can only be given by using a SAT solver.
