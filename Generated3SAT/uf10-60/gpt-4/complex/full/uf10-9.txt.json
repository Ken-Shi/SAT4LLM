                "content": "To solve this set problem, we need to adopt the Davis Putnam Logemann Loveland (DPLL) algorithm which is the fundamental algorithm for almost all modern SAT solvers. This algorithm adopts the backtracking search method to check the satisfiability of propositional logic, with three key features: unit propagation, pure literal elimination and early termination.\n\nFirst, the algorithm explores coming up with an interpretation for one variable to make the initial clause true, say x1=true, and then propagates this 'truth' to other clauses containing that variable.\n\nSecond, if the algorithm finds a literal that always appears in its positive form or always appears in its negative form, then it can be assigned as 'true' or 'false' correspondingly to simplify the problem.\n\nThird, the search can terminate once it finds an empty clause because the empty clause means one interpretation makes one or more clauses false.\n\nThe DPLL algorithm, therefore, proceeds by assigning a truth value to a random unassigned variable, then looks for a unit clause (i.e. a clause with only one unassigned variable), and assigns the variable in the unit clause a truth value such that the clause becomes true. If there isn't a unit clause available, the algorithm picks a random unassigned variable and assigns it a truth value, then repeats the process. If the algorithm reaches a conflict, it will backtrack, and assign a different truth value to the variable.\n\nTo illustrate the above, let\u2019s consider the initial clauses:\n\n-1 -2 -6 0\n\n-7 -1 3 0\n\n-2 -10 3 0\n\nThe variable in the first clause can be assigned the value to make the clause true. For instance, we can assign variable 6 as 'true'. Then we find all clauses that contain 6, and remove them. When variable 6 is true, clause like 6 -7 -9 0 can be true no matter what values variables 7 and 9 are, so this clause no longer plays a role in further search.\n\nContinuing following this procedure and also backtracking when needed, the DPLL algorithm will find a solution that satisfies all clauses if there exists one.\n\nIt should be noted that this is a simplified explanation of the DPLL algorithm.\n\nDue to the complexity and length of the problem provided, solving the problem manually would be impractical, as there are billions of permutations. The algorithm is typically implemented in a program and executed by a high power computer.\n\nAlso, the solution provided by the algorithm won't be unique. The SAT problem might have multiple satisfying solutions. Numerical SAT solver answers also vary based on the solving algorithm and heuristics. Even the same solver can give different answers upon different runs if it incorporates randomness. If no satisfying solution exists, the SAT solver will return 'UNSAT'.\n\nUnfortunately, providing the specific solution for such a considerably large problem exceeds the capabilities of this AI. A practical way to solve this problem would be to use a SAT solver program like MiniSAT, CryptoMiniSat, or Glucose."
