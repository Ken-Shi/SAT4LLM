                "content": "The given problem is a conjunctive normal form problem in boolean logic, which can be solved using a SAT solver. Unfortunately, it is not possible for humans to calculate the solution without a proper SAT solver program.\n\nA SAT solver will start by choosing a random assignment and then proceed with various operations such as unit propagation, pure literal elimination or splitting until a satisfying assignment is found or it has been proven that none exists. The idea of unit propagation is to go through clauses and whenever there is a clause where the literal can only be satisfied in one way (a unit clause), set the variable to satisfy the clause. Pure literal elimination removes variables that always appear with the same polarity.\n\nThis process is difficult to visualize or perform manually and can involve countless operations which aren't feasible to do by hand, especially on large SAT problems. Proper interpretation and presentation of the solution to this problem relies upon high level computation. \n\nAnswer:\nPlease make use of a SAT solver program to find the solution to this problem."
