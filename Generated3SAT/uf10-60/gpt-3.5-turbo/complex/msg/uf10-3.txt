To solve the given SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use a SAT solver. However, if you want to solve it manually, we can start by looking at the clauses given and trying to satisfy them.

The SAT instance has 10 variables and 60 clauses. Our goal is to find an assignment of truth values to the variables that satisfies all the clauses.

Let's try to find a satisfying assignment:
1- Start by assigning Truth to variable 1 to satisfy the clause 9 4 1.  
2- Next, assign Truth to variable 3 to satisfy the clause 2 3 -5.  
3- Now, assign False to variable 5 to satisfy the clause 5 4 3.  
4- We can assign False to variable 7 to satisfy clauses -7 9 -8, -7 -6 4, -7 4 9, -7 -6 1, -10 -7 4, 3 -7 2, 8 -7 -1, -5 -7 -2, 2 -7 3.  
5- Assign Truth to variable 9 to satisfy clauses -8 9 2, -1 3 9, 9 2 3, -8 9 4, 9 -7 4, -1 -10 4, 9 -8 4.  
6- Assign False to variable 10 to satisfy clauses 8 2 10, 1 2 -10, 4 -6 10.  
7- Assign False to variable 8 to satisfy clauses -8 3 2, -8 3 4, -8 2 1, 8 2 -5, 8 -10 -6, -6 8 4.  
8- Assign Truth to variable 4 to satisfy clauses 9 4 1, -6 3 4, -7 -6 4, -1 4 -7, -5 4 -9, 8 3 -10, -7 1 4, 8 -5 4, 3 1 4.  
9- Assign False to variable 6 to satisfy clauses -6 1 3, 3 -8 4, 3 -6 2, -6 -10 -8, 3 -6 -5, 4 2 -8, -8 -6 1, -6 8 9.  
2- Assign False to variable 2 to satisfy clauses 2 3 -5, -6 3 2, -8 1 2, 1 2 -8, -8 1 2, 1 2 -10, 1 -9 3, 8 -7 -1.

Therefore, a satisfying assignment for this SAT problem would be:
1 = True
2 = False
3 = True
4 = True
5 = False
6 = False
7 = False
8 = False
9 = True
10 = False

Therefore, 
answer: 1 -2 3 4 -5 -6 -7 -8 9 -10
