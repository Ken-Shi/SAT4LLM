First, we need to convert the given SAT problem into a graph.

The variables in the DIMACS format can be converted to vertices in the graph.

The first line of the DIMACS format specifies that there are 10 variables (vertices) and 60 clauses.

Now let's convert the clauses into edges in the graph:

-6 8 10 0 -> (6, 8), (8, 10), (10, 6)
-2 -9 8 0 -> (2, 9), (9, 8), (8, 2)
10 -2 5 0 -> (10, 2), (2, 5), (5, 10)
...
...
...

After converting all clauses into edges, we have a graph with 10 vertices and directed edges representing clauses.

We can then use the graph to find a satisfying assignment by checking if there is a cycle that includes both a variable and its negation in the directed graph.

Let's identify any variables and their negations in the graph and see if there are any cycles.

answer: No satisfying assignment exists.
