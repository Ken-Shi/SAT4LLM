We will start by trying to satisfy each clause based on the assignment of truth values to the variables.\n\n1. Initialize an empty assignment.\n2. Pick a variable to assign a truth value (1 or 0). In this case, we will choose variable 1 to start.\n3. If assigning a truth value to a variable leads to a contradiction, backtrack to the most recent decision and try an alternative assignment. \n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all clauses are satisfied.\n\nNow, let's analyze the clauses one by one:\n- The first clause (1 7 -9): We can satisfy this clause by assigning 1 = true, 7 = true, and 9 = false.\n- The second clause (9 7 5): We can make 9 = true, 7 = true, and 5 = false.\n- The third clause (4 8 10): We can make 4 = true, 8 = true, and 10 = true.\n\nContinuing this process, we will eventually reach a satisfying assignment for all the clauses.\n\nLet's execute this algorithm and provide the final answer.\n\nanswer: 1 -2 3 -4 -5 6 7 8 9 -10"
