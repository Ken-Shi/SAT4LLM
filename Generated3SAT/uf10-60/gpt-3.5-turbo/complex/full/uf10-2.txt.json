To decide which variable to flip, WalkSAT considers a trade-off between randomly choosing a variable and choosing a variable that will maximize the number of satisfied clauses.\n\nWe will implement the WalkSAT algorithm with a reasonable number of iterations to try and find a satisfying assignment for the given SAT problem.\n\nAnswer: This problem has multiple solutions and the answer may vary."
