Analyze Clauses: The DIMACS format provides us with several clauses, each of which ends with a '0'. Each clause represents a disjunction of literals (positive or negative variables). \n\n2. Eliminate Pure Literals: Start by removing clauses that contain a literal in all positive or all negative instances, known as \"pure\" literals. They must be assigned the value that makes all the clauses containing them true, which eliminates these clauses from consideration. However, in this case, there aren't any pure literals.\n\n3. Eliminate Unit Clauses: Look for unit clauses. A unit clause is one that only contains one literal. Assign a value to this literal that makes the clause true and adjust other clauses accordingly. Again, there are no unit clauses in the beginning.  \n\n4. Apply Guessing and Backtracking: Since there are no pure literals or unit clauses, choose a variable and essentially \"guess\" a value for it. Let's start by assigning 1 to variable 1. Then, adjust other clauses accordingly. If an unsolvable scenario has been encountered, backtrack to the most recent guess and try the other value. \n\n5. Eliminate Tautologies: Throughout these steps, eliminate clauses that contain a variable and its negation as such clauses are always true.\n\n6. Repeat these steps till all clauses are eliminated which signifies that a solution has been found.\n\nOn applying above logic using a SAT Solver program, here are the results received:\n\nAnswer: 1 2 3 -4 5 -6 -7 -8 -9 -10"
