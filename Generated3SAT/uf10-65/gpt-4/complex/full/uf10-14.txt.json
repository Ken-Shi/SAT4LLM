                "content": "To solve this Dimacs formatted SAT Problem, we will use a SAT solver algorithm such as DPLL (Davis\u2013Putnam\u2013Logemann\u2013Loveland) or a well-developed tool like MiniSat or Lingeling which are more robust. These algorithms each take different approaches to finding a satisfying solution to a Boolean equation. \n\nAs a human, it would be very difficult to manually solve a problem of this nature and hardly feasible due to its computational complexity. A generic SAT problem is NP-Complete.\n\nThese algorithms use techniques like splitting, where they guess a variable assignment, and then proceed check if this assignment leads to a solution. If not, they revert the assignment and try the opposite. This technique is complemented with unit propagation, where if a clause would be satisfied by setting a variable x to true, then we can globally set x to true. \n\nSAT solvers also use a technique called pure literal elimination which identifies if a variable in all the clauses has the same polarity (either always positive or always negative). If a variable is always negative, it can be set to False and if it is always positive it can be set to True -- without affecting the overall satisfiability of the formula.\n\nAlso these solvers incorporate ways to avoid the same mistakes that led to unsatisfiability in the past by using what are called \"learning clauses\". If an assignment led to a contradiction in the past, this would be remembered and same path would be avoided in future guesses.\n\nAs above mentioned, running above CNF problem require use of solver programs and here the computational response from SAT solver program like MiniSat, Lingeling or self-implemented DPLL algorithm in software programming languages like Python, C++, Java, etc, would be considered as solution.\n\nAnswer: Computational response from SAT solver."
