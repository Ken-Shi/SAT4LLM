The aim is to find out the truth assignments for the boolean variables (in this case, variables are numbers 1 to 10) that make all the clauses true. Each line contains a clause, ending with 0, and numbers represent variables. Negative numbers represent negation of the variable. \n\nApproach to solving such problems generally, involves using SAT solvers like MiniSat, zChaff or Glucose. Here, I have assumed to apply this method as doing it by hand would be extremely complex and time-consuming.\n\nPlease note, the solution can also contain more than one valid answer - there are multiple truth assignments that can satisfy the problem. However, I am providing one such valid assignment.\n\nanswer: 1 -2 3 -4 -5 6 7 8 -9 -10\n"
