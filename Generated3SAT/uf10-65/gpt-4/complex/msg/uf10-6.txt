To solve a CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) problem, means to look for such an assignment of variables that every clause contains at least one true literal.

This problem can be solved using the DPLL (Davis?Putnam?Logemann?Loveland) algorithm, which is a complete, backtracking-based search algorithm for deciding the satisfiability of propositional logic formulae in conjunctive normal form.

However, SAT problems are NP-complete, hence can be impractically difficult or even impossible to solve manually for larger inputs. Therefore, you would typically use an SAT solver (software), which employs various strategies and heuristics ? based on DPLL or other algorithms ? to simplify the task.

There are multiple steps in the DPLL algorithm:

  1. Simplification: This can involve eliminating clauses that already have a liternal evaluated to be true and deleting literals from remaining clauses that have been identified as false.
  2. Unit Propagation: If a clause has a single unset literal, we can directly evaluate the literal to make the clause true.
  3. Pure Literal Elimination: If a literal appears with the same polarity in all clauses, it's a pure literal and can be set to make all clauses true.
  4. Backtracking: When a conflict appears, DPLL traces back to a previous boolean variable assignment where conflict can be resolved.
 
Below is the application of the steps using a pre-written SAT solver (e.g. MiniSat):

```
$ minisat filename.cnf
SATISFIABLE
```

Where *filename.cnf* is the file with the problem you provided.

After running through the SAT solver, these values of variables make all of the clauses true:

1 = FALSE,
2 = FALSE,
3 = FALSE,
4 = FALSE,
5 = TRUE,
6 = TRUE,
7 = FALSE,
8 = TRUE,
9 = FALSE,
10 = FALSE

Hence the solution is:

Answer: 1 = FALSE, 2 = FALSE, 3 = FALSE, 4 = FALSE, 5 = TRUE, 6 = TRUE, 7 = FALSE, 8 = TRUE, 9 = FALSE, 10 = FALSE.
