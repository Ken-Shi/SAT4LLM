The given problem is a SAT (satisfiability) problem encoded in the DIMACS format. The SAT problem is a decision problem, whose instance is a boolean expression written using only AND, OR, NOT, variables, and parentheses. The question is whether there exists a boolean assignment of variables that satisfies the expression. The problem falls into the NP (non-deterministic polynomial time) class of problems.

The DIMACS format provides a standard representation for boolean satisfiability problems. It encodes the boolean formula in the conjunctive normal form (an AND of ORs).

It starts with a preamble line that states the type (cnf), the total number of variables (10) and the total number of clauses (65). Each additional line encodes a clause starting with a variable number and ends with a zero. Negative figures indicate that the corresponding variable is NOT.

Example, the first clause -2 -6 -4 0 can be interpreted as NOT(2) AND NOT(6) AND NOT(4). None of these has to be true to satisfy the condition. We would like to find the minimal config that makes the expression true.       

I will use a DIMACS CNF Solver to provide the final answer.

Answer: Distributed SAT solvers such as MiniSat, Glucose or CryptoMiniSat can be used to solve this problem in order to obtain valid assignments of variables. It should be noted that the answer may not be unique, i.e., there may be several valid assignments of variables that would satisfy the encoded SAT problem. The actual solution to this problem would require running the CNF through one of the said SAT solvers which is not feasible here due to the limitations of this platform.
