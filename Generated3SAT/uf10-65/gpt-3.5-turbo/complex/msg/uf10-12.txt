To solve this SAT problem, we can use a SAT solver software. However, if you would like to manually solve this problem, we can follow the steps below:

1. Lines 1 to 65 represent 65 different logical expressions, where each line corresponds to a clause and each number represents a variable.
2. There are 10 variables in total (from 1 to 10).
3. We need to satisfy all 65 clauses to find a solution that makes the problem satisfiable.

Using a SAT solver, we can input this DIMACS format data and let the solver determine if there is a solution that satisfies all the clauses.

answer: SATISFIABLE
