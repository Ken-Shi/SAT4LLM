To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use the DPLL algorithm. 

The DIMACS format provided has 65 clauses and a total of 10 variables. We will start by initializing an empty assignment and an empty set of clauses.

The goal is to assign boolean values (True or False) to each variable in a way that satisfies all the clauses.

We will then apply the DPLL algorithm which involves recursively choosing a variable, assigning a boolean value to it (True or False), and simplifying the clauses based on this assignment.

After applying the DPLL algorithm with the given set of clauses and variables, the final assignment of variables that satisfies all the clauses is the solution to the SAT problem.

answer: 3 -6 -7 -9 -10
