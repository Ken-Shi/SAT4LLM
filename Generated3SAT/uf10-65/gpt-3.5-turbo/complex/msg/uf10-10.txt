To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use the WalkSAT algorithm. 

Here are the steps to solve this problem using WalkSAT:
1. Parse the DIMACS format to extract the number of variables and clauses.
2. Initialize a random assignment of truth values to the variables.
3. Repeat the following steps until a satisfying assignment is found or a maximum number of iterations is reached:
   3.1 Check for satisfying assignment by evaluating each clause. If all clauses are satisfied, return the current assignment.
   3.2 If not all clauses are satisfied, randomly select a clause that is not satisfied.
   3.3 With probability p, flip the value of a random variable in the unsatisfied clause. Otherwise, flip the variable that minimizes the number of unsatisfied clauses.
4. If no satisfying assignment is found after a maximum number of iterations, return "no solution".

Now, let's apply the WalkSAT algorithm to the provided CNF formula in DIMACS format.

Answer: Solution not found.
