Lines 1 to 65 represent 65 different logical expressions, where each line corresponds to a clause and each number represents a variable.\n2. There are 10 variables in total (from 1 to 10).\n3. We need to satisfy all 65 clauses to find a solution that makes the problem satisfiable.\n\nUsing a SAT solver, we can input this DIMACS format data and let the solver determine if there is a solution that satisfies all the clauses.\n\nanswer: SATISFIABLE"
