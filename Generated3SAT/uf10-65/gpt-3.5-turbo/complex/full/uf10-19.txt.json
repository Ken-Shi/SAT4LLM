We will start by initializing an empty assignment and an empty set of clauses.\n\nThe goal is to assign boolean values (True or False) to each variable in a way that satisfies all the clauses.\n\nWe will then apply the DPLL algorithm which involves recursively choosing a variable, assigning a boolean value to it (True or False), and simplifying the clauses based on this assignment.\n\nAfter applying the DPLL algorithm with the given set of clauses and variables, the final assignment of variables that satisfies all the clauses is the solution to the SAT problem.\n\nanswer: 3 -6 -7 -9 -10"
