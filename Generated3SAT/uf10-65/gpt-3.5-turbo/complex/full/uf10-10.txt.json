Parse the DIMACS format to extract the number of variables and clauses.\n2. Initialize a random assignment of truth values to the variables.\n3. Repeat the following steps until a satisfying assignment is found or a maximum number of iterations is reached:\n   3.1 Check for satisfying assignment by evaluating each clause. If all clauses are satisfied, return the current assignment.\n   3.2 If not all clauses are satisfied, randomly select a clause that is not satisfied.\n   3.3 With probability p, flip the value of a random variable in the unsatisfied clause. Otherwise, flip the variable that minimizes the number of unsatisfied clauses.\n4. If no satisfying assignment is found after a maximum number of iterations, return \"no solution\".\n\nNow, let's apply the WalkSAT algorithm to the provided CNF formula in DIMACS format.\n\nAnswer: Solution not found."
