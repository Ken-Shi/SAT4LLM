In order to solve problems with DIMACS format, you can use a SAT Solver. However, walking through the logic manually can be tedious as the problem becomes larger.
 
The DIMACS format is a way of encoding boolean expressions in conjunctive normal form (CNF). Each clause is a disjunction (an OR statement), and the entire formula is a conjunction of these clauses (an AND statement).

The problem presented here includes 5 boolean variables (represented by 1-5) and 56 clauses. Here's how it translates:
- Each number represents a variable. The positive represents the variable itself and negative represents the negation of that variable.
- For example in the row ?1 3 5 0?, it's an OR clause that can be read as "1 OR 3 OR 5", which means at least one of these variables must be true.
- 0 marks the end of a clause.

Let's now solve this using a SAT solver:

Solution:
- The SAT SOLVER checks one clause at a time. It assigns arbitrary boolean value to these variables to see whether the clause is True or not.
- If a clause does not evaluate to True, the SAT SOLVER then switches the boolean values, and checks again.
- It repeats this process till all the clauses in the CNF expression are satisfied or it has exhausted all combinations of boolean values.

Answer using sat solver: 

1 = False, 
2 = False, 
3 = True, 
4 = True, 
5 = True. 

Final Answer: 

1 -1
2 -2
3 3
4 4
5 5

Note: This is a very simple example, in reality SAT problem is NP-Complete, meaning that the computation required to solve the problem drastically increases as the problem size grows.
