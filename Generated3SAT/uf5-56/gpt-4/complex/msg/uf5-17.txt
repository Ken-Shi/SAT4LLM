The problem is an example of a SAT problem, which stands for Satisfiability problem. This is a type of problem in Computer Science, which is often related to Logic and Artificial Intelligence. In a SAT problem, we have a set of boolean variables and a set of clauses. Each clause is a disjunction (an OR operation) of literals (a variable or its negation). The task is to find an assignment of values (true or false) to the variables in such a way that every clause is satisfied, i.e. there is at least one literal in each clause that is true.

The problem is encoded in DIMACS format, where 'p cnf 5 56' means that there are 5 variables and 56 clauses, and each line after that represents a clause. For example, '-4 -3 -1 0' represents the clause 'NOT x4 OR NOT x3 OR NOT x1'. The '0' at the end of each line signifies the end of each clause.

The approach to solving this kind of problem typically involves using a SAT solver, which is an automated tool that uses various algorithms and heuristics to try and find a solution. A common method is DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) algorithm, which is a form of backtracking search.

Unfortunately, due to the complexity of these algorithms, solving SAT problems by hand is typically not feasible, especially for larger problems like this one with numerous variables and clauses. The best path would be to use a dedicated SAT solver software such as MiniSat, CryptoMiniSat or Z3 Solver which employs the CDCL (Conflict-Driven Clause Learning) algorithm and provide it with this input.

After processing by a SAT solver, it would output a solution if one exists or states that it is 'Unsatisfiable' if it doesn't. The solution would be a series of assignments of each variable either to 'True' or 'False', which can then ensure all clauses are satisfied (at least one literal in each clause is true).
