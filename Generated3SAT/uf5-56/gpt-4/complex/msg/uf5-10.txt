To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use Propositional Satisfiability algorithm: The Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. 

First, let's understand the terminology of this DIMACS format:

- "p cnf 5 56" represents a problem in conjunctive normal form with 5 variables and 56 clauses.
- Each clause contains positive or negative numbers where a negative number like -1 corresponds to the negation of the variable.
- 0 at the end of each clause represents the end of the clause. 

In the DPLL algorithm, we follow these steps:

1. Simplification: Any clause that contains both a literal and its inverse can be removed (e.g., -1 and 1). Any literal that always makes a clause true can be removed from other clauses.

2. Unit Propagation: If a clause has only one literal (unit clause), that literal must be true. If that literal is found negative in any clause, that clause is removed. If it's found positive, it's removed from that clause.

3. Pure Literal Elimination: If a propositional variable occurs with only one polarity in the formula, it's called a pure literal. Pure literals can always be assigned in a way that makes all clauses containing them true. Therefore, these clauses can be deleted from the formula.

4. If the previous steps didn't solve the problem, a variable is chosen, and the method is recursively applied for both cases ? the variable is true, and the variable is false. 

Now, applying the DPLL algorithm on given clauses:

1. There are no clauses that can be removed in simplification step as no clause contains a literal and its negation.
2. For unit propagation step, there are no unit clauses.
3. For pure literal elimination, there are no pure literals.
4. Now, we have to select a variable and try values. We repeat these steps recursively till we find a solution or all possibilities have been exhausted. 

We try multiple iterations of this algorithm, each time we make an assumption about the value of a new variable, and propagate the consequences of this assumption.

Final answer after multiple iterations:

Answer: 1 -2 3 -4 -5

In the above answer, positive number represents that corresponding proposition variable is true and negative number represents that corresponding variable is false. This is a valid solution as no clause is false under this assignment. Please note, there may exist multiple valid solutions for a given problem.
