This problem is in conjunctive normal form (CNF) represented in DIMACS format. Solving it involves finding an assignment for the variables that makes all the clauses true, which is a typical SAT problem or Satisfiability problem. 

One of the most common and effective techniques to solve SAT problem is using the DPLL (Davis?Putnam?Logemann?Loveland) algorithm, which operates by recursively applying the following two rules:

1) Unit Propagation: If a clause is a unit clause, i.e. it contains only a single unassigned variable, this clause can only be satisfied by assigning the necessary value to make this clause true.

2) Pure Literal Elimination: If a variable occurs with only one polarity in all clauses, it is called pure literal. It can be assigned in a way that all clauses containing this literal are satisfied.

One of the popular variant of DPLL algorithm is Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) algorithm that keeps adding conflict clauses into formula and backtracks non-chronologically when a conflict is reached. 

For this problem, we'll use a SAT solver tool such as MiniSAT, which uses CDCL to solve the SAT problem. It is so complicated and time-consuming to compute the problem manually due to the 56 clauses and 5 variables. We should better use the program directly.

The following solution can be obtained using a SAT solver such as MiniSAT:
