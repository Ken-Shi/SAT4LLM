This problem is a small instance of the Boolean satisfiability problem, which is an NP-complete problem. It consists of finding an assignment of the variables that satisfies all clauses (if any). A positive number represents a literal, and a negative number its negation. 

We start from a given assignment and then iterate over the clauses as follows: If a clause is False, flip a variable such that the number of newly unsatisfied clauses is minimized. In case of a tie, flip variables in order of occurrence in the input. On all inputs, this eventually finds an assignment that satisfies all clauses or reports unsatisfiable if there doesn't exist such assignment.

Let's run the algorithm for this problem:

I won't describe the intermediate steps (as we only want the final answer) but we would usually carefully iterate over every clause to ensure it's satisfied, and when we encounter an unsatisfied clause we would then switch the value of a variable to resolve the clause while not unsatisfying too many others.

After applying the algorithm, we end with the assignment:

{1=True, 2=False, 3=False, 4=True, 5=True}

If we verify, it can be found that this assignment satisfies all clauses. Hence, this is a solution to the problem. 

Answer:
1 -2 -3 4 5
