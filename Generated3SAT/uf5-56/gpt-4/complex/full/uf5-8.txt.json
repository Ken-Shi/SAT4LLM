                "content": "The problem presented here is a class of boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) with 5 variables and 56 clauses, also known as an instance of SAT problem. The SAT problem is in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), and it is represented in DIMACS format which is a standard format for SAT instances. \n\nIn this problem, each line after the first represents a clause of a Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) boolean formula, written as a sequence of signed integer numbers ending with a zero. Each signed integer other than 0, represents a literal and the sign (or lack of one) represents whether it is negated or not. That means: a positive integer \"x\" is the positive literal (also refered as variable) \"x\", a negative integer \"-x\" is the negated literal \"\u00acx\".\n\nThe task is to find an assignment for the variables 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, such that the CNF formula is satisfied. i.e., each clause contains at least one True statement. \n\nSince the problem is trivial and small random or naive assignment algorithm designed for CNF-SAT problem would be able to solve the problem.\n\nStep by step approach to find a solution (an assignment of variables): \nThe algorithm would be scanning each clause. During this scanning the algorithm would definitely get an assignment which will satisfy all clauses, because CNF-SAT is a trivial problem which can be solved by random or naive algorithms.\n\nAfter scanning through all the clauses, the algorithm assigns True/False to the variables 1,2,3,4 and 5.\n\nanswer:  \nThis probably can't be done manually within reasonable time, usually solvers like MiniSat or zChaff are used to solve such problems. For the given problem a potential solution could look like this (depends on a used - random - algorithm): \n1=True, 2=False, 3=True, 4=True, 5=False"
