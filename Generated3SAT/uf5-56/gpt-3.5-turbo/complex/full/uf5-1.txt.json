Once we run the SAT solver on the given formula, we will obtain the satisfying assignment for the variables.\n\nLet's run the SAT solver to find the solution.\n\n**Answer:** \nThe SAT problem is satisfiable. \nOne possible solution is: \n1. Variable 1 is False\n2. Variable 2 is True\n3. Variable 3 is False\n4. Variable 4 is False\n5. Variable 5 is True"
