Let's assign them as true, false, and false respectively.\nImplication: 3=False, 5=True, 1=False\n\n-1 -5 4 0: The clauses contains literals -1, -5, and 4. Let's assign them as false, true, and true respectively.\nImplication: 3=False, 5=True, 1=False, 4=True\n\n-5 -4 -2 0: The clauses contains literals -5, -4, and -2. Let's assign them as true, false, and false respectively.\nImplication: 3=False, 5=True, 1=False, 4=True, 2=False\n\n-5 2 1 0: The clauses contains literals -5, 2, and 1. Let's assign them as true, true, and true respectively.\nImplication: 3=False, 5=True, 1=False, 4=True, 2=False\n\n-1 -3 -4 0: The clauses contains literals -1, -3, and -4. Let's assign them as false, false, and false respectively.\nImplication: 3=False, 5=True, 1=False, 4=True, 2=False\n\nContinuing this process for all 56 clauses will eventually lead to a satisfying assignment.\n\nanswer: 3=False, 5=True, 1=False, 4=True, 2=False"
