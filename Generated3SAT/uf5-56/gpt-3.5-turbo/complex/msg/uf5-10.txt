To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to find a satisfying assignment that makes all the clauses true. The first step is to convert the given DIMACS format into a more readable form:

-1 4 2
3 -1 -5
2 3 1
-4 1 -5
5 4 1
3 1 2
-5 4 3
-5 2 4
4 3 2
2 3 5
4 3 -1
1 -2 -5
-5 3 4
5 2 4
-5 1 2
3 1 -5
1 -5 3
1 4 -2
4 2 1
-5 3 1
-2 1 3
-5 4 3
4 3 1
4 3 2
1 3 2
1 -5 4
4 3 2
1 4 -5
4 2 1
-5 3 -2
1 -5 4
3 2 1
1 -4 -5
3 -5 2
2 1 -5
1 3 4
3 -5 -1
1 3 -5
4 1 3
-5 2 4
1 -5 4
1 3 -4
2 -5 4
1 -5 -3
1 4 3
4 3 2
4 2 3
-5 4 -3
3 1 4
-5 4 3
4 -5 2
1 2 -5
1 -5 -2
1 -5 4
-5 1 2
4 2 3

Next, we will start solving the problem using the unit propagation method:

1. From clause 1: Choose -1 to make clause 1 true. Update other clauses accordingly.
2. From clause 6: Choose 2 to make clause 6 true. Update other clauses accordingly.
3. From clause 14: Choose -5 to make clause 14 true. Update other clauses accordingly.
4. From clause 55: Choose -2 to make clause 55 true. Update other clauses accordingly.

After these steps, we have the following reduced set of clauses:
4 2 1
4 -5 3
4 1 3

Since there are no more unit clauses or conflicts, we randomly choose values for the remaining variables in the reduced set of clauses:
Assign 2 = T, 5 = F, and 3 = T.

Hence, the satisfying assignment for the given SAT problem is:
1 = F, 2 = T, 3 = T, 4 = T, 5 = F

answer: 2 3 4 0
