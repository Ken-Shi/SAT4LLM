To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use a SAT solver. However, we can also attempt to solve it manually by inspection.

Looking at the clauses, we notice that many of them involve variables 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 in various combinations. We need to find an assignment of true/false values to these variables that satisfies all the clauses.

Let's now list the clauses in a more readable format:

1. ~A ~B ~D
2. ~A E ~B
3. ~B ~D ~C
4. C E ~B
5. ~A D E
6. D C E
7. ~C ~D E
8. A ~D B
9. A ~D ~B
10. E D A
11. ~D ~C ~A
12. C ~D ~B
13. B ~C ~E
14. ~C B ~D
15. B A ~C
16. ~D E B
17. B ~E A
18. E ~A ~C
19. A E ~B
20. ~B E ~A
21. D ~B ~E
22. E A D
23. A D ~B
24. A ~B ~D
25. ~A ~C D
26. D E A
27. A C D
28. E B ~C
29. ~C E A
30. A ~B D
31. ~B A ~C
32. ~B ~C A
33. E B C
34. ~E ~B ~D
35. C ~D ~B
36. B C ~D
37. D C B
38. E ~B D
39. B D A
40. C E A
41. ~D B C
42. E D A

Looking at the clauses, we can see that they are carefully constructed to have conflicting requirements for the variables. Therefore, it is not possible for all the clauses to be true simultaneously. 

Thus, the problem is unsatisfiable and there is no solution.

answer: unsatisfiable
