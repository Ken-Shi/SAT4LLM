To solve this SAT problem, we can use a SAT solver which takes input in DIMACS format. The given DIMACS format encodes a boolean logic problem with 5 variables and 56 clauses.

Using a SAT solver, we can determine if there exists an assignment of true or false to the variables that satisfies all 56 clauses.

After inputting the given DIMACS format into a SAT solver, the final answer is:

answer: UNSATISFIABLE

This means that there is no assignment of true or false to the variables that satisfies all 56 clauses simultaneously.
