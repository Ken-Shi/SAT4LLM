To solve this SAT problem, I will use a SAT solver to determine the assignment that satisfies all the clauses in the DIMACS format.

The DIMACS representation of the problem has 5 variables and 56 clauses.

Running the SAT solver on the provided CNF expression, the solution is as follows:

answer: 1 -2 -3 4 5

Therefore, the assignment that satisfies all the clauses is variable 1 is true, variable 2 is false, variable 3 is false, variable 4 is true, and variable 5 is true.
