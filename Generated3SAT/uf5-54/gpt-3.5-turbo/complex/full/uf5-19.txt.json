The numbers after that are the literals in the clause, where a positive number represents the variable being true and a negative number represents the variable being false. A '0' indicates the end of the clause.\n- We need to find an assignment to the variables 1 to 5 that satisfies all the clauses.\n\nLet's solve the problem:\n\nThe CNF formula encoded in DIMACS format has 54 clauses and 5 variables (1 to 5).\n\nAfter applying the rules of the SAT problem resolution we get:\n\nanswer: 1 -2 3 -4 5"
