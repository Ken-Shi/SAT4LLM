However, since the answer needs to be provided without running those tools, we need to think through the problem logically.\n\nThe DIMACS format given provides a set of conditions, each represented as a clause with literals. The literals are either positive or negative integers representing variables.\n\nLooking at the clauses in the DIMACS format, we can see that each line represents an OR relationship between the literals. There are a total of 54 clauses in this problem with 5 variables (1 to 5).\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find a satisfying assignment that makes all of the clauses true by assigning values to the variables 1 to 5 accordingly.\n\nBased on the analysis of the clauses, we can see there are patterns where multiple clauses contain the same set of literals but with a different polarity.\n\nThe solution to this SAT problem in DIMACS format is:\nanswer: 1 -2 -3 4 -5"
