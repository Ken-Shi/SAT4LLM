                "content": "First, we can simplify the problem by removing redundant clauses:\n- Remove duplicate clauses\n- Remove clauses that are the exact negation of another clause\n\nAfter simplification, we get the following 9 clauses:\n1 4 -5 0\n1 5 -2 0\n1 -2 -3 0\n-5 -3 -4 0\n-3 1 -5 0\n1 -3 -5 0\n-5 1 -2 0\n-3 -5 -2 0\n-2 4 1 0\n\nThese clauses can be represented as a matrix:\n| 1  4 -5  0 |\n| 1  5 -2  0 |\n| 1 -2 -3  0 |\n| 5 -3 -4  0 |\n| 3  1 -5  0 |\n| 1 -3 -5  0 |\n| 5  1 -2  0 |\n| 3  5 -2  0 |\n| 2  4  1  0 |\n\nTo solve this SAT problem, we can start with an arbitrary assignment of true or false to each variable and then evaluate each clause to see if it is satisfied. If a clause is not satisfied, we need to change the truth assignment of the variables in a way that would satisfy that clause.\n\nAlternatively, we can also use a SAT solver like MiniSat or Z3 to quickly find a satisfying assignment.\n\nanswer: 1 0 0 1 0"
