First, we can simplify the problem by removing redundant clauses:
- Remove duplicate clauses
- Remove clauses that are the exact negation of another clause

After simplification, we get the following 9 clauses:
1 4 -5 0
1 5 -2 0
1 -2 -3 0
-5 -3 -4 0
-3 1 -5 0
1 -3 -5 0
-5 1 -2 0
-3 -5 -2 0
-2 4 1 0

These clauses can be represented as a matrix:
| 1  4 -5  0 |
| 1  5 -2  0 |
| 1 -2 -3  0 |
| 5 -3 -4  0 |
| 3  1 -5  0 |
| 1 -3 -5  0 |
| 5  1 -2  0 |
| 3  5 -2  0 |
| 2  4  1  0 |

To solve this SAT problem, we can start with an arbitrary assignment of true or false to each variable and then evaluate each clause to see if it is satisfied. If a clause is not satisfied, we need to change the truth assignment of the variables in a way that would satisfy that clause.

Alternatively, we can also use a SAT solver like MiniSat or Z3 to quickly find a satisfying assignment.

answer: 1 0 0 1 0
