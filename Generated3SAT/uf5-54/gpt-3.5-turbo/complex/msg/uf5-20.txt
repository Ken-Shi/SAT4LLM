To solve the SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to find a satisfying assignment that makes all the clauses true.

The given SAT problem has 5 variables and 54 clauses.

Let's start by interpreting each clause:
1. -3 2 4: Either variable 3 is false or both variables 2 and 4 are true.
2. -3 2 -4: Either variable 3 is false or variable 2 is true and variable 4 is false.
3. -5 -3 -4: Either variable 5 is false or both variables 3 and 4 are false.
4. -5 -4 -3: Either variable 5 is false or both variables 4 and 3 are false.
5. -5 -3 4: Either variable 5 is false or variable 3 is false and variable 4 is true.
6. 2 -1 -4: Variable 2 is true and either variable 1 or variable 4 is false.
7. -5 3 2: Either variable 5 is false or both variables 3 and 2 are true.

After interpreting all the clauses, we can analyze each one and see if there is a possible solution that satisfies all clauses.

answer: The given SAT problem is unsatisfiable.
