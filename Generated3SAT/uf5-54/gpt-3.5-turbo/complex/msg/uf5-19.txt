Given the SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to find a satisfying assignment for the boolean variables represented by numbers 1 to 5.

Here is a brief line of thoughts:
- The first number in each line represents a clause. The numbers after that are the literals in the clause, where a positive number represents the variable being true and a negative number represents the variable being false. A '0' indicates the end of the clause.
- We need to find an assignment to the variables 1 to 5 that satisfies all the clauses.

Let's solve the problem:

The CNF formula encoded in DIMACS format has 54 clauses and 5 variables (1 to 5).

After applying the rules of the SAT problem resolution we get:

answer: 1 -2 3 -4 5
