To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to go through each clause and assign values to the variables in such a way that all the clauses are satisfied. Let's go through the clauses:

1. -4 1 3 0: Since each clause has 3 literals, we can satisfy this clause by assigning true to 1 and 3, and false to 4.
2. 3 1 -4 0: This clause is already satisfied based on the assignment from the first clause.
3. 2 -4 1 0: This clause can be satisfied by assigning true to 1, false to 4, and true to 2.
4. -4 1 5 0: This clause is already satisfied based on the assignment from the first clause.
5. 2 5 4 0: This clause can be satisfied by assigning true to 2, true to 5, and false to 4.
6. -4 1 2 0: This clause is already satisfied based on the assignments from previous clauses.
7. 4 3 5 0: This clause can be satisfied by assigning true to 3, true to 4, and true to 5.

Continuing in this manner, we can go through each clause and assign values to the variables to satisfy all of them. After going through all clauses, the final assignment that satisfies all of them is:
1 = True
2 = True
3 = True
4 = False
5 = True

Therefore, the solution is:
answer: 1 1 1 0 1
