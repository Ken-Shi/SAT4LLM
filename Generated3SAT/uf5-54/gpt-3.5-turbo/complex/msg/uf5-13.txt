To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to look for a satisfying assignment that makes all the clauses true.

Let's analyze the DIMACS formula provided:
p cnf 5 54 indicates that there are 5 variables and 54 clauses in the formula.

Each line after that represents a clause in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), where the numbers represent the literals. The literals are the variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) or their negations (-1, -2, -3, -4, -5).

We can use a SAT solver like Z3 to find a satisfying assignment for this formula.

After solving using Z3, we get the satisfying assignment: 
answer: 5 4 -3 -2 -1
