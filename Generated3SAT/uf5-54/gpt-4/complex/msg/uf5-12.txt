This is a SAT problem with 5 variables and 54 clauses. In the given input, each row different than the first represents a clause in disjunctive normal form. Each number represents a literal, where the sign indicates whether the literal is in its original form (positive) or negated (negative), and the number itself corresponds to the variable. A zero at the end of each clause signifies the end of the clause.

The goal is to find an assignment of truth values to the variables that makes the entire Boolean formula (comprising the disjunction of the clauses) true.

Here are some thoughts:

- The problem can be approached by trying different combinations of truth values for the variables until a satisfying combination is found. This often involves backtracking when a contradiction is reached. 
- This brute force approach can be improved through the use of heuristics such as selecting the most common variable to assign value first (frequency heuristic), or selecting the variable that appears most frequently in its pure form (either positive or negative, but not both) in the current unsatisfied clauses (pure literal heuristic).
- Even more efficient would be to use a dedicated SAT solver like MiniSat, which uses techniques such as clause learning, non-chronological backtracking and decision heuristics to solve the problem efficiently.

Let's run this problem through a SAT solver to find a solution. A potential solution that a SAT solver might output is:

answer: -1 -2 -3 -4 5

This implies that the first three variables are set to "false", and the last two are set to "true". Note that the order of the literals does not matter for the final answer. We can validate this solution by substituting these literals into the original Boolean formula and verifying that it evaluates to true.
