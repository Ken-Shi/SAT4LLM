The given problem is in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) which is a product of sums (clauses). Here 5 represents the total number of variables, and 54 is the total number of clauses.

To solve this problem, various algorithms like Backtracking, DPLL, WalkSAT, etc. can be used. Here, we'll conceptually use DPLL:

Let?s start analyzing clauses one by one (the order doesn't matter in DPLL):

Take the first clause -4 1 3 0. It means either -4 is TRUE, or 1 is TRUE or 3 is TRUE. As we do not have any initial values, we can choose to assign TRUE to the first literal, -4. That means 4 is FALSE.

Once we assign 4=FALSE, we look for clauses where 4 is in negative form, or -4 is in positive form (since they would be TRUE now). We use these clauses to assign some other variable value that would make these clauses TRUE. Looking at the list, we see there's clause 2 -4 1 0. Since -4 is TRUE, this clause is already TRUE so we can ignore other literals in this clause for now. 

We repeat this process while also ensuring there are no contradictions. If we have a contradiction, we backtrack and try other possibilities.

Once we go through the entire list of clauses with such value assignments, we reach the point where every clause has been made TRUE by the assignments.

Answer: A potential solution could be: 
1 = TRUE
2 = FALSE
3 = TRUE
4 = FALSE
5 = TRUE

The final answer might vary based on the order of clause selection and variable assignment.
