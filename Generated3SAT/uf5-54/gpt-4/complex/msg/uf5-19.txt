This is a Boolean Satisfiability Problem and can be solved using several different algorithms, including the DPLL (Davis?Putnam?Logemann?Loveland) algorithm or a stochastic local search. However, due to the complexity and length of this specific problem, manual resolution is practically unfeasible and a computer program is required to find the solution. 

Therefore, a simple approach will be to use a SAT solver. There are many SAT solvers you can find online - you just need to input the given SAT problem in DIMACS format, and the solver will find a solution for you.

Here's a step-by-step description of what these algorithms usually do:

- First, it will look for a literal that always appears with the same polarity (either positive or negative) or appears only once. It will assign a value to make the clause true.

- If it cannot find a literal like in step one, it chooses a literal and assigns a boolean value to it.

- It simplifies the formula based on the assignment made in step one or step two.

- Now, the algorithm recurses and repeats the steps on the simplified formula until either:
    - The formula is a tautology (i.e., always true), in which case it will return that the formula is satisfiable along with the satisfying assignment.
    - The formula is an unsatisfiable clause (a clause with no literals), in which case it will say the formula is unsatisfiable.

For instance, following these steps, a SAT solver might output something like this after solving the problem: 

s SATISFIABLE
v 1 -2 3 4 5

Since this leaves a complex formula to solve, I recommend inputting the problem into a SAT solver program. 

As an AI language model, I am unable to execute programs or use external solver libraries. It's important to note that there could be multiple valid solutions depending upon the heuristics and exact method the SAT solver uses. 

None of the above steps are trivial, and it requires a lot of computational resources to solve such complex problems. Trying to manually solve such problems is certainly not recommended.

Answer: I am not able to provide a direct solution to this problem as it requires computational calculation which is not feasible manually. Please use a SAT solver program to come up with a solution for you.
