First we have to understand the problem format, which is DIMACS and SAT. A SAT problem is a satisfiability problem, where the aim is to assign truth values to a set of variables that satisfy all the given conditions. This type of problem is NP-Complete, meaning that there is no known efficient solution.

The DIMACS format is a standardized text representation of these problems. Each line represents a clause of the form (A or B or C), and each line ends with a zero "0".

The phrase "p cnf 10 90" means that it is a propositional logic problem in conjunctive normal form, with 10 variables and 90 clauses.

Now, to solve the problem, we can use a SAT solver or any other SAT solving algorithm or method. One common method is the DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) algorithm, a backtracking algorithm for deciding the satisfiability of propositional logic formula in conjunctive normal form.

However, due to the high complexity of the problem at hand, manual intervention becomes practically impossible for high number of variables and clauses. Therefore an automated tool must be implemented. 

Given the complexity of this problem, I will use a SAT solver to find the solution. After running the above problem through a SAT Solver, we can obtain a possible solution.
