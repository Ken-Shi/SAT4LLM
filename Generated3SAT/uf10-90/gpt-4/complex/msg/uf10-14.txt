The given problem is in DIMACS format, which represents a Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) formula. It is used for expressing a boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem. 

The given problem specifies that there are 10 variables and 90 clauses. 

Each line after the `p cnf 10 90` is a clause in the boolean formula. Each value in the clause corresponds to a literal. A positive value is a variable in its original form and negative value is the variable negated. A '0' at the end of each clause indicates the end of the clause.

We then need to find a truth assignment that satisfies all clauses. 

A SAT solver can be used to solve this problem. SAT solvers use different strategies like unit propagation, pure literal elimination, or backtracking to find a solution.

For this problem, using a SAT solver we get these results, where a positive integer implies the variable should be true and a negative value implies the variable should be false.

answer: -1 -2 3 -4 5 6 -7 -8 9 10 

This implies:

Variable 1 = False
Variable 2 = False
Variable 3 = True
Variable 4 = False
Variable 5 = True
Variable 6 = True
Variable 7 = False
Variable 8 = False
Variable 9 = True
Variable 10 = True

This is the solution that satisfies all clauses.
