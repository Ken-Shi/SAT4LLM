Solving a SAT (Satisfaction) problem, especially one of this complexity, often utilizes an approach called the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. The DPLL algorithm is a recursive backtracking search procedure that progressively reduces the problem to simpler sub-problems until a solution is reached. This kind of problem is usually solved using a SAT solver, an automated algorithmic solution.

SAT solvers often use a combination of heuristics, like pure literal elimination and unit propagation. 

In pure literal elimination, if a variable appears with the same polarity in all clauses, we can assign a value to it that satisfies all those clauses. Whereas, in unit propagation, if a variable appears alone in a clause (a unit clause), it can immediately be assigned a value such that the clause is satisfied.

Simply put, a SAT problem like the above is attempting to find a set of boolean variables that makes all clauses true. In the DIMACS format given, each line represents a clause. Each clause is expressed as a conjunction of literals (here as integers, where absolute value corresponds to variable and sign to its polarity), and the entire sentence is a disjunction of these clauses. The '0' at the end of each line signifies end of a clause.

While a step-by-step, hand-driven solution for this problem is exceptionally complex due to the significant number of variables and clauses involved, I can tell you how one might approach it.

The general approach starts with applying simplifying rules (such as elimination of pure literals, unit propagation and resolution rule). The solver then picks a variable and assigns a boolean value to it (this might be chosen through heuristics). The problem is then simplified based on that assignment. If a contradiction occurs, the solver will backtrack and try a different assignment. If no contradiction is found, another variable is assigned and this process continues until a satisfying assignment is found or all possibilities have been exhausted. The answer obtained is the set of values assigned to the variables that satisfy the entire sentence.

Given the complexity of the problem, it is extremely calculative in nature and practically unfeasible to solve manually, thus I?m unable to provide a manual, hand-driven solution.

Answer: This problem is best solved using appropriate software or algorithms that implement SAT solving strategies.
