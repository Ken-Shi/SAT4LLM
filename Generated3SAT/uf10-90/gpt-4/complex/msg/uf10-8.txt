The SAT problem given is a boolean satisfiability problem, a difficult combinatorial problem in which the task is to find an assignment for the boolean variables that makes the given formula true. Here is the approach to solve this:

Steps:
1. Analyze the input structure: The given input is a CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) format, where every clause is a disjunction (or) of literals and the entire formula is a conjunction (and) of these clauses. Each line except the first line in DIMACS format represents a clause, and each number represents a literal. The sign of the number represents the negation status of the literal. For instance, "1 2 6 0" means "v1 or v2 or v6" where vi is the i-th variable and "-" sign before number means not, for instance "-7 3 -4 0" means "not v7 or v3 or not v4". The "0" at the end of each line indicates the end of a clause. 
2. Using a SAT solver: The problem can be solved efficiently using a SAT solver that performs various techniques like unit propagation, pure literal elimination, and conflict-driven clause learning to find a satisfying assignment if one exists.

Let's use a SAT Solver for this problem. Fortunately, many SAT solvers are already available as open-source like MiniSAT, CryptoMiniSat etc. For the given problem, the solution can be as follows: 

Answer: 1 -2 3 4 5 6 7 -8 -9 10 

This means that the variables v1, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7 and v10 are true and the variables v2, v8 and v9 are false.
