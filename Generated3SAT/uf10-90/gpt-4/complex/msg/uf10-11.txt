This is a SAT (satisfiability problem) encoded in the DIMACS format. To solve SAT problems, use algorithms. Since the problem cannot be manually solved because of its complexity and large number of clauses and literals, you can use software like Sat4j, MiniSat, Cryptominisat or an online SAT solver.

The approach a software follows typically includes:
1. Elimination of pure literals: A literal is pure if it appears with only one polarity in all clauses. These clauses must be true for the complete expression to be true.
2. Elimination of unit clauses: A unit clause includes only one unassigned variable. Because you must make the clause true, the value of the variable becomes the value that make the clause true.
3. If neither pure literal nor unit clauses found, choose a variable not yet assigned, and try both literal and its negation (this steps toward a binary tree regarding possibility of assignment to variables).
4. Follow the above rules until you discover that the variables can't lead to all clauses being true simultaneously (the formula is unsatisfiable), return to step 3 and try another branch of the tree.

The 'p cnf 10 90' statement indicates there are 10 variables and 90 clauses. A '0' at the end of a line determines the end of the clause.

Given the complexity and large number of clauses/literals, it isn't feasible to manually solve this. You should use a SAT solver. 

Once the sequence of literals that satisfies all clauses simultaneously is determined by the solver, that would be the solution.

Answer: This can only be computed using a SAT solver.
