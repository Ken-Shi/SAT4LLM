Before solving, let's understand our problem. This problem is a Boolean Satisfiability problem in conjunctive normal form (CNF). Each line encodes a clause, and each clause is a disjunction of literals (where a literal is a variable or its negation). For instance, the line "10 8 5 0" represents the clause "10 OR 8 OR 5". The goal is to find an assignment of true or false to each variable that satisfies all of the clauses.

The first step to solving this problem is to transform the input into a more usable format. We can represent the set of clauses as a list of lists. In this format, each inner list is a clause and each number is a variable.

Next, we will use a standard SAT solving algorithm: the DPLL (Davis?Putnam?Logemann?Loveland) algorithm. The DPLL algorithm is a recursive backtracking algorithm, as follows:

1. If the set of clauses is empty, return True. 
2. If there is a clause that is empty (because we assigned False to all its variables), return False.
3. Choose a variable not yet assigned.
4. Recursively probe the assignments. 

This algorithm will terminate when every clause is satisfied.

However, manually doing DPLL for a problem of this size is practically impossible. Thus we will use a SAT solver. Software SAT solvers like MiniSAT or Z3 are efficient and based on the DPLL algorithm or its variants, and can be easily applied on your DIMACS format using basic coding.

I can't provide the assignment as it requires running a SAT solver, which isn't possible manually and would typically be performed with the assistance of a computer.

Answer: I can't provide the final answer as it requires a software SAT solver.
