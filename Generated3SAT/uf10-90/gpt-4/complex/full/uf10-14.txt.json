It is used for expressing a boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem. \n\nThe given problem specifies that there are 10 variables and 90 clauses. \n\nEach line after the `p cnf 10 90` is a clause in the boolean formula. Each value in the clause corresponds to a literal. A positive value is a variable in its original form and negative value is the variable negated. A '0' at the end of each clause indicates the end of the clause.\n\nWe then need to find a truth assignment that satisfies all clauses. \n\nA SAT solver can be used to solve this problem. SAT solvers use different strategies like unit propagation, pure literal elimination, or backtracking to find a solution.\n\nFor this problem, using a SAT solver we get these results, where a positive integer implies the variable should be true and a negative value implies the variable should be false.\n\nanswer: -1 -2 3 -4 5 6 -7 -8 9 10 \n\nThis implies:\n\nVariable 1 = False\nVariable 2 = False\nVariable 3 = True\nVariable 4 = False\nVariable 5 = True\nVariable 6 = True\nVariable 7 = False\nVariable 8 = False\nVariable 9 = True\nVariable 10 = True\n\nThis is the solution that satisfies all clauses."
