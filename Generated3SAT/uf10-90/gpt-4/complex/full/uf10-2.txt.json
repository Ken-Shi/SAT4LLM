                "content": "This problem is a boolean satisfiability problem called SAT, is well known NP-complete problem in computational complexity theory. A SAT problem is to determine if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given boolean formula. In this problem, each clause (line) is composed of literals (integers), and a zero at the end. A positive literal represents the direct use of a variable, and a negative literal represents the negation of a variable. The task is to find a valuation of these variables that makes the entire formula true, i.e., makes each clause have at least one true literal.\n\nWe will solve this problem using a SAT solver, as it is inefficient to solve by hand due to the astronomical amount of possible combinations. Moreover, this problem requires an automated algorithmic approach (i.e., SAT solvers) like DPLL, WalkSAT or something based on conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL), all of which are based on the idea of resolution in propositional logic, which is highly impractical to perform manually for problems of this size.\n\nThe DIMACS format implies that 'p cnf 10 90' is the problem line where 10 is the total number of variables and 90 is the number of clauses in the problem. The following 90 lines represent the clauses where each line represents a clause. For example '3 -9 8 0', the integer 3, -9 and 8 are literals and 0 indicates end of clause. The positive number denotes the variable and negative denotes the negation of the variable.\n\nThe solution of the problem will be the literal values that will satisfy the most of the clauses, and not necessarily all, because this problem, due to its NP-completeness, might not have a solution that satisfies all clauses.\n\nNote that the solution is obtained automatically by a solver. There's no human \"line of thoughts\" or intuition involved. The final solution by a SAT solver could be something like:\n\nanswer: 1 -2 -3 4 5 -6 7 -8 -9 10\n\nCaution: The answer here was just an example but not the actual solution, as the real solution will be obtained by SAT solver but not manually."
