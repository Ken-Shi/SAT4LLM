The problem can be solved by finding any possible combination of truth values for the propositions.At the end, a model is satisfying only if each clause has at least one positive literal. It is then, therefore, approached by a constructive method such as depth-first search and applied the unit propagation repeatedly.\n\nAfter going through the list of clauses, we find the solution that each variable is either True or False, I denote True as '1' and False as '-1'.\n\nThe answer to this SAT problem:\n\nanswer: 1 -1 1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 1"
