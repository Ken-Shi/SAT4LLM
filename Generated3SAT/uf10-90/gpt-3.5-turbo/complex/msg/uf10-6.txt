To solve this SAT problem, we will use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment. The DIMACS format given encodes the problem. Each line represents a clause with literals separated by spaces. The numbers preceding the clauses indicate the number of variables and the number of clauses in the problem.

Since the problem is in CNF form and contains 10 variables and 90 clauses, we can input this directly into a SAT solver to find a solution.

I will use an online SAT solver to solve this problem and provide the satisfying assignment as the final answer.
