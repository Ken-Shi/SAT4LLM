To solve this SAT problem, we will use the WalkSAT algorithm which is a local search algorithm commonly used for solving SAT problems.

First, we need to convert the DIMACS format into a more readable format. The clauses are as follows:

1. (-5 OR 6 OR 4)
2. (-5 OR 8 OR 3)
3. (-1 OR -3 OR -10)
4. (-9 OR -3 OR -10)
5. (-10 OR 7 OR 1)
6. (-1 OR 8 OR -6)
7. (-10 OR 4 OR -8)
8. (-10 OR 2 OR 9)
9. (-8 OR 4 OR 3)
10. (7 OR -3 OR -2)
... and so on.

Now, we will use WalkSAT to find a satisfying assignment for this problem.
