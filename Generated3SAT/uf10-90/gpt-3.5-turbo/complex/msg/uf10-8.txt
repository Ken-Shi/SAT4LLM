To solve the SAT problem in DIMACS format, we will use the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm, a simple backtracking algorithm commonly used for solving SAT problems.

First, we will represent the problem encoded in DIMACS format:
p cnf 10 90
1 2 6 0
-7 3 -4 0
6 -4 10 0
-7 -8 -5 0
3 4 2 0
3 -5 1 0
...
-7 2 10 0

Now, we will apply the DPLL algorithm:
1. Start by selecting a variable, let's start with variable 1 as true.
2. Remove all clauses that contain variable 1 as true and remove negations of variable 1 in other clauses.
3. Repeat the process with the reduced set of clauses until all clauses are satisfied.

Using the DPLL algorithm, we will go through all the clauses and apply unit propagation, pure literal elimination, and splitting to simplify the problem.

After applying the DPLL algorithm, we arrive at a satisfying assignment:
answer: 1 -2 3 4 -5 6 -7 -8 -9 -10
