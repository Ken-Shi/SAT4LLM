To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to interpret the clauses given and find a satisfying assignment if one exists. 

Given DIMACS format:
p cnf 10 90
9 4 -6 0
4 2 1 0
9 -1 -7 0
... (more lines)

We have 10 variables and 90 clauses.

Let's break down the problem:
- There are 10 variables: 1 through 10.
- There are 90 clauses with 3 literals each.
- We will try to find a satisfying assignment that makes all the clauses true.

Now, we will use a SAT solver to find the solution. Let's proceed with finding the satisfying assignment.
