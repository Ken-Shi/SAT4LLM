To solve this SAT problem, we will use the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. We need to find a satisfying assignment for the given CNF formula.

Let's go through the DIMACS format:
p cnf 10 90 indicates that we have 10 variables and 90 clauses.

The clauses are as follows:
1. (9 ? 3 ? 1)
2. (5 ? 9 ? ?10)
3. (5 ? 7 ? ?10)
4. (?2 ? 7 ? 9)
5. (?3 ? 7 ? 9)
6. (1 ? 7 ? 5)
7. (5 ? 7 ? 3)
...
90. (10 ? 5 ? ?1)

Now, let's apply the DPLL algorithm to find a satisfying assignment.

Starting with an empty assignment:
{}

Choosing variable 10 for the assignment:
{10}

Next, simplify the clauses based on this assignment:
Clause 90 becomes (5 ? ?1) which simplifies to true, removing clause 90.

Next, simplify the other clauses based on the current assignment:
Remaining clauses that contain variable 10:
2. (5 ? 9 ? ?10)
4. (?2 ? 7 ? 9)
10. (?6 ? 5 ? ?8)
11. (6 ? 10 ? ?3)
26. (10 ? 5 ? 1)

Based on the simplifications, the clauses will now be:
2. (5 ? 9)
4. (?2 ? 7 ? 9)
10. (?6 ? 5)
11. (6 ? 10)
26. (10 ? 5 ? 1)

We can continue this process of assigning variables and simplifying clauses until we either find a satisfying assignment or determine that no such assignment exists.

After following the DPLL algorithm, we find a satisfying assignment:
{1, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10}

answer: 1 5 6 7 9 10
