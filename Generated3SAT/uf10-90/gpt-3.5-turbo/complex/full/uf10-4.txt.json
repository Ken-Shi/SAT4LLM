(more lines)\n\nWe have 10 variables and 90 clauses.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n- There are 10 variables: 1 through 10.\n- There are 90 clauses with 3 literals each.\n- We will try to find a satisfying assignment that makes all the clauses true.\n\nNow, we will use a SAT solver to find the solution. Let's proceed with finding the satisfying assignment.\n\n**answer: ** SATISFIABLE\nSATISFIABLE\n1 -2 3 -4 -5 6 -7 8 9 10"
