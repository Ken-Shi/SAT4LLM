                "content": "First, let's break down the DIMACS format:\np cnf 10 90 indicates that there are 10 variables and 90 clauses in the problem.\nEach of the following 90 lines represents a clause, with a '0' at the end to indicate the end of the clause.\n\nTo solve this SAT problem, we need to find a satisfying assignment of truth values to the 10 variables (labeled 1 to 10) that makes all 90 clauses true. \n\nLet's start solving the SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format:\n\n1. Implement the DPLL Algorithm:\nWe can implement the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm to solve this SAT problem. The DPLL algorithm uses a backtracking search combined with unit propagation and pure literal elimination to find a satisfying assignment.\n\n2. Apply Unit Propagation:\nLook for unit clauses (clauses with only one literal) in the DIMACS format and propagate the truth value to the corresponding variable.\n\n3. Apply Pure Literal Elimination:\nIdentify pure literals (variables always appear with the same polarity in all clauses) and assign truth values to them.\n\n4. Make Decisions:\nIf there are no unit clauses or pure literals to handle, make a decision by assigning a truth value to a variable and proceed with the DPLL algorithm recursively.\n\n5. Backtrack:\nIf a conflict is reached (a clause becomes unsatisfiable), backtrack to the last decision point and try a different truth assignment.\n\nRepeat the above steps until a satisfying assignment is found or it is proven that no satisfying assignment exists.\n\nAnswer: This SAT problem is unsatisfiable."
