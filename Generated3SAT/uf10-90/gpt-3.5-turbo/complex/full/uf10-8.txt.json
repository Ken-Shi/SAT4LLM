Start by selecting a variable, let's start with variable 1 as true.\n2. Remove all clauses that contain variable 1 as true and remove negations of variable 1 in other clauses.\n3. Repeat the process with the reduced set of clauses until all clauses are satisfied.\n\nUsing the DPLL algorithm, we will go through all the clauses and apply unit propagation, pure literal elimination, and splitting to simplify the problem.\n\nAfter applying the DPLL algorithm, we arrive at a satisfying assignment:\nanswer: 1 -2 3 4 -5 6 -7 -8 -9 -10"
