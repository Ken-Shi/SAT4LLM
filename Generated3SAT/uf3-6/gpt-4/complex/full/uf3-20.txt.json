SAT (Satisfiability Testing) is a procedure used to check if an expression in propositional logic can be satisfied. The SAT problem is one of the fundamental problems in computer science and is known to be NP-complete. This instance of SAT problem is expressed in what's known as DIMACS format.\n\nBriefly explaining the instance: \n\n- The \"p cnf 3 6\" line tells us that this is a SAT problem in conjunctive normal form with 3 variables (named 1, 2, and 3) and 6 clauses. \n\n- Each of the next 6 lines represents one clause. \n\n- Within each clause, positive numbers stand for the plain variable (e.g., \"3\" means the variable 3 is TRUE), and negative numbers stand for the variable's negation (e.g., \"-2\" means the variable 2 is FALSE). \n\n- A \"0\" on its own stands at the end of each clause, serving as a terminator. \n\nApproach:\n\nTo solve this problem, we use backtracking to try different assignments of TRUE and FALSE to the 3 variables and checking whether each assignment satisfies all the clauses. \n\nIf there is a variable assignment that satisfies all clauses, the problem instance is satisfiable; if no such assignment exists, the instance is unsatisfiable.\n\nAnalysis and Solution:\n\nBy analyzing the problem, one solution is variable 1 = TRUE, variable 2 = FALSE, and variable 3 = TRUE which satisfy all the clauses. Thus:\n\n1) 3 -2 1 0 becomes TRUE (-2=FALSE is TRUE because 2 is FALSE) 1 (1 is TRUE because 1 is TRUE)\n2) 1 -2 3 0 becomes TRUE (-2=FALSE is TRUE because 2 is FALSE) 3 (3 is TRUE because 3 is TRUE)\n3) 3 -1 2 0 becomes TRUE (-1=FALSE is TRUE because 1 is TRUE) 2 (2 is FALSE because 2 is FALSE)\n4) 3 2 1 0 becomes TRUE 2 (2 is FALSE because 2 is FALSE) 1 (1 is TRUE because 1 is TRUE)\n5) -2 3 1 0 becomes -2=FALSE is TRUE because 2 is FALSE) 3 (3 is TRUE because 3 is TRUE) 1 (1 is TRUE because 1 is TRUE)\n6) -2 -1 3 0 becomes -2=FALSE is TRUE because 2 is FALSE) -1=FALSE is TRUE because 1 is TRUE) 3 (3 is TRUE because 3 is TRUE)\n\nIn all clauses, at least one variable is True (clause is satisfied) with this assignment so this is a solution.\n\nanswer: 1=True, 2=False, 3=True"
