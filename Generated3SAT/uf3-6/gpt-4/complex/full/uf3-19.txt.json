                "content": "Firstly, let's understand what is the DIMACS format. It is a standard way to express Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems, commonly used in computer science for this type of problems. The number before the keyword \"cnf\" defines the maximum number of variables, and the number after \"cnf\" designates the number of clauses.\n\nThe selected problem has 3 variables (x1, x2, x3), and 6 clauses, shown below:\n\n    1: x3 or \u00acx1 or \u00acx2\n    2: x3 or \u00acx1 or \u00acx2\n    3: \u00acx1 or x3 or \u00acx2\n    4: x2 or x1 or x3\n    5: \u00acx1 or x3 or \u00acx2\n    6: \u00acx1 or x3 or \u00acx2\n\nTo satisfy the problem, we must find a set of {x1, x2, x3} which makes all the clauses true. \n\nNow, let's try to solve the problem:\n\nFrom clauses 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 we can conclude that setting x3 to be true (x3=1) will make these clauses true, because there is \"x3 or ...\" for each of these clauses, so no matter what are the values of the other variables, this clause will be true if x3 is true.\n\nLooking at the clause 4: x2 or x1 or x3, this clause is also true if x3 is true.\n\nThis shows that assigning x3 to be true makes all the clauses true, no matter what the values of x1 and x2 are. \n\nTherefore, we can say that this SAT problem is satisfiable for any values of x1 and x2 when x3 is true.\n\nAnswer: {x1=0, x2=0, x3=1}, {x1=1, x2=0, x3=1}, {x1=0, x2=1, x3=1}, {x1=1, x2=1, x3=1}"
