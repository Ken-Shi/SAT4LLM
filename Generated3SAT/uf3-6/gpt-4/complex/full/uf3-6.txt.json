                "content": "First, let's understand the DIMACS format of this SAT problem:\n\nThe first line 'p cnf 3 6' specifies the problem type and size. 'p' signifies a problem, 'cnf' means it's in conjunctive normal form, 3 is the number of variables, and 6 is the number of clauses.\n\nThe rest of the lines each represent a clause of the problem. In each clause, each integer refers to a different variable and a negative sign in front of a number denotes the negation of that variable. The 0 at the end signifies the end of the clause.\n\nIn this case, our three variables could be referred as A, B, C and assume 1, 2, 3 respectively, invoking the expression according to the DIMACS format. \n\nThe clauses can be interpreted as follows:\n(-A v -B v C),  (-C v -A v -B), (-C v -B v A), (-B v -C v A), (-B v -C v A), (A v -C v -B)\n\nNow let's solve it:\n\nThe first and second clause already give us a conflicting pair. One requires 'C' be true (since 'A' and 'B' have to be false), but the next requires 'C' to be false (since 'A' and 'B' again have to be false). \n\nA normal SAT solver would find this out quickly via the unit propagation technique, which basically means if all but one literals in a clause are false, the remaining one must be true. And then it would quickly detect that there is no possible assignment. Hence, there is no solution to this SAT problem.\n\nAnswer: UNSOLVABLE"
