                "content": "Looking at the given SAT problem, each line after \"p cnf 3 6\" denotes a clause of our problem. The numbers stand for three different literals (or variables), which can be true (if the number is positive) or false (if the number is negative). A 0 at the end denotes the end of each clause. \n\nAs there are only 3 different literals (1, 2, 3) and because a literal can be either true or false, there are 2^3 = 8 possible assignments. However, most of these assignments aren't valid, as they don't make every clause true.\n\nExamining the provided clauses, -1 appears in every clause meaning that the literal 1 must be false, because it is not possible to make every clause true if literal 1 is true.\n\nWith literal 1 being false, we now look at the implications for the other literals. The first clause now reads 3 2 0, which means either literal 3 or literal 2 must be true. \n\nNow, looking at the rest of the clauses, we can see that literal 3 appears in all of them. In the last clause, it appears as -3 along with -2 and -1, the latter two of which we've already determined as false. Therefore, literal 3 must be true (because a clause is true if at least one of its literals is true).\n\nSo literals 1 and 2 have to be false, and literal 3 has to be true.\n\nAnswer: Literal 1 = false, Literal 2 = false, Literal 3 = true."
