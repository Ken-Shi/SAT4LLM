To find a possible assignment that satisfies all clauses, one needs to inspect these clauses and apply some heuristics such as unit clause, pure literal, ... etc. 

From the problem, there are 3 literals (1, 2, and 3) and 6 clauses. Each number means the variable number, while a minus in front of the number means that the literal is negated (for e.g., -2 means not 2). Here are the listed clauses:

1. (1 OR 3 OR NOT 2)
2. (1 OR NOT 2 OR NOT 3)
3. (3 OR NOT 2 OR 1)
4. (NOT 2 OR 1 OR 3)
5. (2 OR 1 OR NOT 3)
6. (NOT 2 OR 3 OR 1)

First, we look for a unit clause, i.e., a clause with only one literal, but there is none. Then, we look for pure literals, i.e., literals that appear only in one polarity (negated or not) across all clauses. Literal '1' is a pure literal since it appears always positively. So we can assign '1' to true, which automatically satisfies clauses 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. 

Now we only need to satisfy clause 5: (2 OR 1 OR NOT 3). Since '1' is true, clause 5 is already satisfied, regardless of the values of 2 and 3. 

So, the first solution that came up is '1' = true, then whatever the values of '2' and '3' are, it wouldn't affect the result. 

Answer: The model that satisfies all clauses is {1 = true, 2 = true / false, 3 = true / false}.-'
