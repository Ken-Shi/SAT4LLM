It is a 3-SAT problem with 3 variables (1, 2, 3) and 6 clauses. The problem is to find a truth assignment that satisfies all clauses.

Here are the clauses:

1. (3 OR 2 OR 1) 
2. (NOT 1 OR 3 OR 2)
3. (1 OR 3 OR 2)
4. (1 OR 2 OR NOT 3)
5. (NOT 1 OR 2 OR 3)
6. (3 OR 2 OR NOT 1)

Each clause is a disjunction which means at least one of literals needs to be true for each of them.

My line of thoughts for this is to check for each variable if it can be both true and false. 

Let's start with variable 1:

a) If we assume 1 to be true, every clause that doesn't contain NOT 1 could potentially be satisfied already. Clauses 1, 3 and 4 contain pure 1 and can be considered as true.

b) If we assume 1 to be false, any clause that contains NOT 1 could potentially be satisfied. Clauses 2 and 5 do contain NOT 1 and hence can be considered as true. However, clause 1 and 3 contain pure 1 and hence cannot be satisfied anymore. This means that 1 has to be true.

Next, let's consider variable 2:

a) With 2 as true, clauses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 all can be satisfied as they all contain 2.

b) Assuming 2 is false, it seems no clause can be satisfied as they all contain 2. So, it is necessary for 2 to be true.

Finally, let's consider variable 3:

a) With 3 as true, clauses 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 can be satisfied as they contain 3.

b) However, assuming 3 as false, it seems only clause 4 can be satisfied as it contains NOT 3. Thus, 3 has to be true as well.

So we have 1 = true, 2 = true, 3 = true as the satisfied set.

Answer: {1 = true, 2 = true, 3 = true}
