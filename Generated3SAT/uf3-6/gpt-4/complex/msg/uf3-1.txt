The problem is encoded in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) in the DIMACS format. In this format, `p cnf 3 6` indicates there are 3 variables and 6 clauses. The numbers in each line represent literals, and 0 marks the end of a clause. Negation is represented by a negative sign in front of a variable. 

Here's how to solve the problem:

Firstly, let's take each clause separately:

Clause 1: -1 -2 3 (this clause is TRUE if either -1, -2, or 3 is TRUE)

Clause 2: -2 -1 -3 (this clause is TRUE if either -2, -1, or -3 is TRUE)

Clause 3: -1 -2 -3 (this clause is TRUE if either -1, -2, or -3 is TRUE)

Clause 4: -1 2 -3 (this clause is TRUE if either -1, 2, or -3 is TRUE)

Clause 5: -2 -1 3 (this clause is identical to the first clause)

Clause 6: -2 3 -1 (this clause is TRUE if either -2, 3, or -1 is TRUE)

Looking at the clauses together, it's clear that there are several contradictions? clauses that cannot be TRUE at the same time. Clause 6 and Clause 2 are direct contradictions - Clause 6 requires that either -2 or 3 while Clause 2 requires that either -2 or -3. Also, clause 1 and 4 are a contradiction because Clause 1 requires that either -1 or 3 should be TRUE, while Clause 4 requires -1 or -3 to be TRUE.

We therefore can conclude that this set of clauses has no solution?it is UNSATISFIABLE. For a constraint to be satisfiable, there should be no conflicting conditions.

answer: UNSATISFIABLE
