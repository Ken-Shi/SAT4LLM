This is a Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT problem) and the given statements are in DIMACS format, which is a standardized text format widely utilized to define the inputs for these types of problems. Each line except the first represents a clause, where each non-zero integer represents a literal (or its negation). A clause is a disjunction (an 'or' operation) of literals, while the whole problem is a conjunction (an 'and' operation) of these clauses. A problem is satisfiable if there exists an assignment of true or false to each literal such that every clause is true.

Approaching this problem, you might notice that literals 1, 2, and 3 all appear both in the positive and negative forms across different clauses. This implies that you need to meticulously determine the right assignments so that all clauses are satisfied.

The DIMACS CNF problem in a more human-readable format is as follows:
(!3 or !1 or !2) and
(!1 or 3 or !2) and
(!3 or 2 or 1) and
(!1 or !2 or !3) and
(!1 or !2 or !3) and
(!1 or !3 or !2)

Now let's try to find an assignment of variables that will result in each clause being true.

By looking at the clauses, we notice that every clause includes -1. Therefore, one logical approach is to set 1 = false, to try to satisfy all the clauses at once.

After that, 2 and 3 can be set to true to ensure all clauses are satisfied.

In this case, every clause becomes true with these assignments, and thus the entire conjunction is true. This means the problem is satisfiable and the chosen assignments constitute a viable solution.

answer:

1=false, 2=true, 3=true
