The given CNF is a conjunctive normal form that specifies a boolean satisfiability problem, also known as SAT. The problem is to determine if there exists an assignment of truth-values to the boolean variables that would make the formula true. 

Structure of the problems in DIMACS format:
- p cnf 3 6: This line states that the problem is in the CNF format, has 3 variables (we can call them x1, x2, x3), and has 6 clauses. 
- Following lines until the end are the clauses of the formula. Each line represents a clause and is a disjunction (OR operation) of literals. Each literal is either a variable (represented by positive integer) or the negation of a variable (represented by negative integer). '0' at the end of lines denotes the end of a clause.

My steps for solving the SAT Problem:

1. Start with arbitrary truth values for the 3 variables and evaluate each clause.
2. If a clause is false, pick one literal from the clause and flip its truth value. 
3. Continue this process, iterating through the clauses, until each clause is true.

Let's start with all variables set to false. 

First clause: -3 2 1 0; means: NOT(x3) OR x2 OR x1. Given our initial truth values (false, false, false), this clause is false as all literals are false.

Set got literal x1 (third literal in first clause) to true and reassess:

Second clause: 2 1 3 0; means x2 OR x1 OR x3. Clause is true (x1 is true).

Third clause: -1 3 2 0; means: NOT(x1) OR x3 OR x2. The clause is false (all literals are false).

Set x3 to true and reassess :

Fourth clause: 2 3 1 0; means: x2 OR x3 OR x1. Clause is true (x1 and x3 are true).

Fifth clause: 3 2 1 0; means: x3 OR x2 OR x1. Clause is true (x1 and x3 are true).

Sixth clause: 1 3 2 0; means: x1 OR x3 OR x2. Clause is true (x1 and x3 are true).

After iterating through all the clauses, all of them are true, the assignment (false, true, true), where x1=true, x2=false, x3=true, is a solution to the SAT problem.

Answer: x1=true, x2=false, x3=true
