The SAT problem is represented in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), which is a conjunction (AND) of one or more clauses, where a clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals. In our problem we have 3 literals which are the variables 1, 2, and 3 and we have 6 clauses defined as follows:

- Clause 1: -1 OR 2 OR 3 
- Clause 2: 2 OR 3 OR -1
- Clause 3: 3 OR -1 OR 2
- Clause 4: 2 OR 1 OR 3
- Clause 5: 3 OR 1 OR 2
- Clause 6: -1 OR 3 OR 2

Let's solve our SAT problem now. We can satisfy all of the conditions by looking at the negations of the literals. All clauses except for clauses 4 and 5 contain "-1". Therefore, we have to set our variable 1 to False in order to fulfill these conditions.

Now let's look at the rest of the literals in the clauses:

- Clauses 1, 2, 3, and 6: They contain "2 OR 3". Here, we have the freedom to choose either 2 or 3 to be True. We will set 2 to True.

- Clauses 4 and 5: They contain "2 AND 3". Again, we have the freedom to choose either 2 or 3 to be True. We already set 2 to true, so this condition is also satisfied.

This leaves us with literal 3. We were free to decide this literal in each clause. It can therefore be set to either True or False.

Answer: 1=F, 2=T, 3=T/F
