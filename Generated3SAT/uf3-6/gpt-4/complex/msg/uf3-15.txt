The problem asks to find an assignment for 3 variables such that all 6 clauses are satisfied. Here, the DIMACS CNF format is basically a list of clauses where each clause is a disjunction of literals. A literal can either be a variable or the negation of a variable. A clause written as `-2 3 -1 0` is equivalent to saying `NOT x2 OR x3 OR NOT x1` (0 is an end-of-clause marker and it is just used for the formatting purposes). 

Let's break it down clause by clause:

1) -2 3 -1 0: This clause is true when the second variable is `False`, the third variable is `True`, OR the first variable is `False`.
2) 1 2 3 0: This clause is true when either the first, second, or third variable is `True`.
3) 2 -3 -1 0: This is true when the second variable is `True`, the third variable is `False`, OR the first variable is `False`.
4) 2 3 -1 0: This is true when the second variable, third variable are `True`, OR the first variable is `False`.
5) 2 3 -1 0: This is the same clause repeated, so the same conditions apply.
6) -1 3 2 0: This is true when the first variable is `False`, the third variable is `True`, OR the second variable is `True`.

After analyzing the clauses, an assignment of x1=False, x2=True, x3=True will satisfy all conditions.

Answer: x1=False, x2=True, x3=True
