The SAT problem in question is encoded in the DIMACS format, which is commonly used to represent problems in propositional logic for input into SAT solvers.

A single line in the given problem represents a clause of a Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). A CNF is a conjunction of disjunctions, which is equivalent to saying an AND of ORs. An individual number in a clause represents a literal. A positive number is a positive literal and a negative number is a negated literal.

Your problem is in 3-CNF, meaning there are 3 literals per clause, and is described by the DIMACS as having 3 variables and 6 clauses.

The clauses can be rewritten in a more human friendly format like this:
1) NOT c OR a OR NOT b
2) NOT c OR b OR a
3) NOT c OR b OR a
4) NOT c OR a OR b
5) NOT c OR b OR a
6) b OR a OR NOT c

Now, to solve the SAT problem, we need to find the truth assignments of the variables that makes all the clauses true. 

Looking at the clauses:
In the first 5 clauses, 'c' is negated indicating that it needs to be false for the expression to be true.
There are three instances of '-2' (not b) and three instances of '2' (b). As these instances are equal it does not affect the result, thus we can place either true or false.
Similarly, the '1' (a) appears in every clause and we need it to be true in order to satisfy the proposition.

So, we conclude that the assignments: c needs to be false, a needs to be true, and b can be either true or false, would satisfy all the clauses.

So finally, a = true, b = true or false, c = false, which in the DIMACS format would be written as:

Answer: 1 -2 or 1 2 -3
