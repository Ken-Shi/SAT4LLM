Line of thoughts:
- We have 3 variables and 6 clauses in total.
- We will try to find an assignment of truth values to the variables that satisfies all the clauses.

Let's go through each clause:
1. (3 1 2) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning true to variable 3 and false to variables 1 and 2.
2. (1 2 3) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning true to variables 1, 2, and 3.
3. (-1 3 2) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning false to variable 1 and true to variables 3 and 2.
4. (1 2 3) - This is a duplicate of clause 2.
5. (1 -3 2) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning true to variables 1 and 2, and false to variable 3.
6. (3 1 2) - This is a duplicate of clause 1.

Therefore, the solution that satisfies all clauses is:
3 = true
2 = true
1 = true

answer: 1=true, 2=true, 3=true
