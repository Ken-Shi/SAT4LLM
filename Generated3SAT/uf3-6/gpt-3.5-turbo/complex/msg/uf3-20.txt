To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can go through the clauses one by one and try to find a satisfying assignment.

The CNF formula has 3 variables and 6 clauses:
- Clause 1: ?x3 ? ?x2 ? x1
- Clause 2: x1 ? ?x2 ? x3
- Clause 3: ?x3 ? x1 ? x2
- Clause 4: x3 ? x2 ? x1
- Clause 5: ?x2 ? x3 ? x1
- Clause 6: ?x2 ? ?x1 ? x3

Let's attempt to find a satisfying assignment by considering all possible combinations of variable assignments:
- If x1 = 1, x2 = 0, x3 = 1:
  - Clause 1: True
  - Clause 2: True
  - Clause 3: True
  - Clause 4: True
  - Clause 5: True
  - Clause 6: False
  This assignment is satisfying.

Therefore, the satisfying assignment for the given SAT problem is:
answer: x1 = 1, x2 = 0, x3 = 1
