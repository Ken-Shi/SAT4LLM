To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can follow these steps:

1. Translate the DIMACS format into a more readable form:
(3, -1, -2)
(3, -1, -2)
(-1, 3, -2)
(2, 1, 3)
(-1, 3, -2)
(-1, 3, -2)

2. We can see that each line represents a clause, and the numbers represent variables. The positive number means the variable is included, and the negative number means the variable is negated.

3. Now, we can try to find a satisfying assignment for the variables to make all the clauses true. This can be done by trial and error or through a more systematic approach like the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm.

4. After trying different combinations, we can see that the following assignment satisfies all the clauses:
x1 = False
x2 = False
x3 = True

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: x1=False, x2=False, x3=True
