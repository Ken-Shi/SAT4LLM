To solve this problem, we need to analyze the clauses in the DIMACS format provided.

The first clause, -3 1 2 0, means that either -3 or 1 or 2 must be true. Similarly, the second clause, 1 2 -3 0, states that either 1 or 2 or -3 must be true.

By analyzing all the clauses, we can see that the only satisfying assignment that makes all the clauses true is when 1 is true, 2 is true, and -3 is false.

Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:
answer: 1 1 0
