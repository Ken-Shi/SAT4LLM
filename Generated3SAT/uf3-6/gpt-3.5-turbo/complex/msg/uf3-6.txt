To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will first analyze the clauses one by one. 

The DIMACS format given is:
p cnf 3 6
-1 -2 3 0
-3 -1 -2 0
-3 -2 1 0
-2 -3 1 0
-2 -3 1 0
1 -3 -2 0

We have 3 variables (1, 2, 3) and 6 clauses.

1. Clause 1: -1 -2 3
This means either variable 1 or variable 2 must be false and variable 3 must be true.

2. Clause 2: -3 -1 -2
This means either variable 3 or variable 1 or variable 2 must be false.

3. Clause 3: -3 -2 1
This means either variable 3 or variable 2 must be false and variable 1 must be true.

4. Clause 4: -2 -3 1
This means either variable 2 or variable 3 must be false and variable 1 must be true.

5. Clause 5: -2 -3 1
This is identical to Clause 4, so it does not provide any new information.

6. Clause 6: 1 -3 -2
This means variable 1 must be true and either variable 3 or variable 2 must be false.

To satisfy all clauses, the solution should be:
1 = True
2 = False
3 = False

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: 1 -2 -3
