To solve this SAT problem, we can directly reason through the DIMACS format:

p cnf 3 6
1 -2 -3 0
-2 -3 1 0
1 -3 -2 0
-3 -2 1 0
-3 1 -2 0
-3 -1 -2 0

There are 3 variables and 6 clauses in this problem. Let's represent the variables as x1, x2, and x3.

From the clauses, we can interpret the conditions:
1. x1 must be true (1) because it appears positively in clauses 1, 3, and 5
2. x2 must be false (-2) because it appears negatively in clauses 1, 2, and 3
3. x3 must be false (-3) because it appears negatively in clauses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6

Therefore, one possible solution is:
x1 = 1
x2 = 0
x3 = 0

answer: x1=1, x2=0, x3=0
