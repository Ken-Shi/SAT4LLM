To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can follow these steps:

1. The first line "p cnf 3 6" indicates that there are 3 variables and 6 clauses in the problem.

2. The clauses are:
- Clause 1: (-1 OR 3 OR 2)
- Clause 2: (-1 OR 3 OR -2)
- Clause 3: (-1 OR 3 OR -2)
- Clause 4: (-1 OR 3 OR -2)
- Clause 5: (-1 OR -2 OR 3)
- Clause 6: (-2 OR -3 OR -1)

3. We can try to satisfy each clause by assigning values to the variables:
- If we assign true to variable 1, clause 1, 2, 3, and 4 will be satisfied. However, clause 5 and 6 will be unsatisfied.
- If we assign true to variable 2, only clause 5 will be satisfied and all other clauses will be unsatisfied.
- If we assign true to variable 3, all clauses except for clause 6 will be satisfied.

4. Based on the analysis above, we can see that there is no single assignment of variables that satisfies all clauses. Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is UNSATISFIABLE.

answer: UNSATISFIABLE
