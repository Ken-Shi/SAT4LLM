To solve this SAT problem, we will go through the clauses and try to find a satisfying assignment. 

The DIMACS format is as follows:
p cnf 3 6
-2 -3 -1 0
-1 2 3 0
-3 -2 -1 0
-2 3 -1 0
3 -2 -1 0
-1 -2 -3 0

There are 3 variables and 6 clauses. Now let's analyze the clauses:

1. Clause: -2 -3 -1
This means that either variable 2 or variable 3 or variable 1 must be True.
2. Clause: -1 2 3
This means that either variable 1 is False or variable 2 is True or variable 3 is True.
3. Clause: -3 -2 -1
This means that either variable 3 is False or variable 2 is False or variable 1 is False.
4. Clause: -2 3 -1
This means that either variable 2 is False or variable 3 is True or variable 1 is False.
5. Clause: 3 -2 -1
This means that either variable 3 is True or variable 2 is False or variable 1 is False.
6. Clause: -1 -2 -3
This means that either variable 1 is False or variable 2 is False or variable 3 is False.

Combining the information from all the clauses, we can see that variable 1 must be False, variable 2 must be False, and variable 3 must be True in order to satisfy all the clauses.

Therefore, the satisfying assignment is:
1. Variable 1 = False
2. Variable 2 = False
3. Variable 3 = True

answer: -1 -2 3
