To solve this problem, we need to decode the DIMACS format provided. Here's how the problem looks in logical form:

1. (!B v C v !A)
2. (A v B v C)
3. (B v !C v !A)
4. (B v C v !A)
5. (B v C v !A)
6. (!A v C v B)

Now we can try to simplify the logical statements:

- From Statement 1 and Statement 3, we can see that if B is true, then both C and A must be false. So, B must be false.
- From Statement 4, we can see that either B or C must be true, since A must be false. But since B is false, C must be true.
- From Statement 2, since C is true, A must also be true.

Therefore, the final solution is:
A = 1
B = 0
C = 1

answer: A=1, B=0, C=1
