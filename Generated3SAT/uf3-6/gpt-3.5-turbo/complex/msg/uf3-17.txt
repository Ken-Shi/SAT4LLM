To solve this SAT problem, we first need to understand the DIMACS format. The first line "p cnf 3 6" indicates that there are 3 variables and 6 clauses in the problem. Each clause is represented as a sequence of integers ending with 0.

Now, let's analyze each clause:
1. 3 -1 -2 0: This clause is satisfied if either variable 3 is true or both variable 1 and variable 2 are false.
2. -2 -1 -3 0: This clause is satisfied if variable 2 is false or both variable 1 and variable 3 are false.
3. 3 -1 -2 0: This is a duplicate of the first clause.
4. 3 -2 -1 0: This clause is satisfied if either variable 3 is true or both variable 1 and variable 2 are false.
5. 1 -2 3 0: This clause is satisfied if either variable 1 is true or variable 2 is false or variable 3 is true.
6. 1 3 -2 0: This clause is satisfied if either variable 1 is true or variable 3 is true or variable 2 is false.

To satisfy all clauses, we can assign the following values to variables:
- Variable 1 = True
- Variable 2 = False
- Variable 3 = True

Therefore, the solution is:
answer: 1 -2 3
