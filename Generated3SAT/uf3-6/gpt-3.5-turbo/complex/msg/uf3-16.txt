To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to find a satisfying assignment for the given boolean formula. The first line indicates that there are 3 variables and 6 clauses in the formula.

The clauses are as follows:
1. (3 OR 2 OR 1)
2. (NOT 1 OR 3 OR 2)
3. (1 OR 3 OR 2)
4. (1 OR 2 OR NOT 3)
5. (NOT 1 OR 2 OR 3)
6. (3 OR 2 OR NOT 1)

To solve this problem, we can go through the clauses one by one and see if we can find a satisfying assignment for each clause. 

- For clause 1, we can set all three variables to true (3 OR 2 OR 1).
- For clause 2, we can set variable 1 to false and variables 3 and 2 to true (NOT 1 OR 3 OR 2).
- For clause 3, we can set all three variables to true (1 OR 3 OR 2).
- For clause 4, we can set variables 1 and 2 to true and variable 3 to false (1 OR 2 OR NOT 3).
- For clause 5, we can set variable 1 to false and variables 2 and 3 to true (NOT 1 OR 2 OR 3).
- For clause 6, we can set variables 3 and 2 to true and variable 1 to false (3 OR 2 OR NOT 1).

Therefore, the satisfying assignment for this SAT problem is:
1. Variable 1: false
2. Variable 2: true
3. Variable 3: true

answer: 1 1 -1
