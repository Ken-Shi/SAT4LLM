DIMACS format represents a SAT problem in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). In this case, we have 3 variables and 6 clauses. The clauses are as follows:

1. (-1 ? 2 ? 3)
2. (2 ? 3 ? -1)
3. (3 ? -1 ? 2)
4. (2 ? 1 ? 3)
5. (3 ? 1 ? 2)
6. (-1 ? 3 ? 2)

To solve this problem, we can use the DPLL algorithm or any other SAT solver. The clauses can be represented as follows:

1. {?1, 2, 3}
2. {2, 3, ?1}
3. {3, ?1, 2}
4. {2, 1, 3}
5. {3, 1, 2}
6. {?1, 3, 2}

Let's try to find a satisfying assignment:

1. Assigning 1 to true:
{?1, 2, 3} => {false, 2, 3} => {2, 3}

2. Assigning 2 to true:
{2, 3, ?1} => {2, 3, false} => {2, 3}

3. Assigning 3 to true:
{3, ?1, 2} => {3, false, 2} => {3, 2}

So the solution is:
- Variable 1 is false
- Variable 2 is true
- Variable 3 is true

Therefore, the satisfying assignment is: 
answer: 2 3 -1
