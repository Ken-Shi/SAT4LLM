To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to find a satisfying assignment for the boolean variables represented by the numbers 1, 2, and 3 in the clauses provided.

The DIMACS format starts with "p cnf" followed by the number of variables (3 in this case) and the number of clauses (6 in this case). Each line after that represents a clause in conjunctive normal form (CNF), where the variables are listed followed by a 0.

Let's analyze each clause:
1. -3 2 1 0 : This means either variable 3 is false or both variables 2 and 1 are true.
2. 2 1 3 0 : This means at least one of the variables 2, 1, or 3 must be true.
3. -1 3 2 0 : This means either variable 1 is false or both variables 3 and 2 are true.
4. 2 3 1 0 : This means at least one of the variables 2, 3, or 1 must be true.
5. 3 2 1 0 : This means at least one of the variables 3, 2, or 1 must be true.
6. 1 3 2 0 : This means at least one of the variables 1, 3, or 2 must be true.

From the above analysis, we can see that there are multiple possible satisfying assignments for this problem. One possible solution is:
- Variable 1 is false
- Variable 2 is true
- Variable 3 is true

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: 1 -2 3
