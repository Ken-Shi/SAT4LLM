To solve this SAT problem, we need to analyze the DIMACS format provided:

p cnf 3 6
-2 1 -3 0
3 -1 -2 0
1 2 3 0
-3 -2 1 0
3 1 2 0
-2 1 -3 0

The first line indicates that there are 3 variables and 6 clauses. The clauses are listed below that line.

Now, let's analyze each clause:
1. Clause: -2 1 -3
This means that either variable 2 is false or variable 1 is true or variable 3 is false.
2. Clause: 3 -1 -2
This means that either variable 3 is true or variable 1 is false or variable 2 is false.
3. Clause: 1 2 3
This means that either variable 1 is true or variable 2 is true or variable 3 is true.
4. Clause: -3 -2 1
This means that either variable 3 is false or variable 2 is false or variable 1 is true.
5. Clause: 3 1 2
This means that either variable 3 is true or variable 1 is true or variable 2 is true.
6. Clause: -2 1 -3
This is a duplicate of the first clause.

We can solve this by simplifying the clauses and finding a satisfying assignment. Looking at clauses 3, 5, and 6, we see that the only way for all three to be true is if all variables are true.

Therefore, the satisfying assignment is:
- Variable 1 is true
- Variable 2 is true
- Variable 3 is true

So, the final answer is:
answer: 1 1 1
