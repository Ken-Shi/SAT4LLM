First, let's simplify the problem by converting it into a logical representation:

Let's say variables X1, X2, X3 represent the values for 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

The given clauses can be represented as follows:
1. (-X1 ? -X2 ? X3)
2. (-X2 ? -X1 ? -X3)
3. (-X1 ? -X2 ? -X3)
4. (-X1 ? X2 ? -X3)
5. (-X2 ? -X1 ? X3)
6. (-X2 ? X3 ? -X1)

To solve this satisfiability problem, we need to find a combination of values for X1, X2, and X3 that satisfy all the clauses. We will construct a truth table to represent all possible combinations and determine if there is a solution.

X1	X2	X3	Clause 1	Clause 2	Clause 3	Clause 4	Clause 5	Clause 6
T	T	T	F	F	F	F	F	F
T	T	F	F	T	F	F	T	F
T	F	T	T	F	F	F	F	T
T	F	F	T	T	F	T	T	F
F	T	T	F	F	T	T	F	F
F	T	F	F	T	T	T	F	F
F	F	T	T	F	T	T	T	F
F	F	F	T	T	T	T	T	T

From the truth table, we can see that there is no combination of values for X1, X2, and X3 that satisfy all the clauses. Therefore, the problem is unsatisfiable.

answer: unsatisfiable
