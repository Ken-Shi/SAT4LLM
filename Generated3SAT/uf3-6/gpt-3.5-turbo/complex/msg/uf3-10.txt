To solve this problem, first, we need to interpret the CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) encoding provided in DIMACS format. The first line "p cnf 3 6" tells us that there are 3 variables and 6 clauses in the problem.

Now, let's examine each clause:
1. (-3 1 -2): Either variable 3 is false, or variable 1 is true, or variable 2 is false.
2. (-3 2 1): Either variable 3 is false, or variable 2 is true, or variable 1 is true.
3. (-3 2 1): Same as clause 2.
4. (-3 1 2): Either variable 3 is false, or variable 1 is true, or variable 2 is true.
5. (-3 2 1): Same as clauses 2 and 3.
6. (2 1 -3): Either variable 2 is true, or variable 1 is true, or variable 3 is false.

To satisfy all clauses, we need to assign values to variables that make all clauses true. Looking at clauses 1, 4, and 6, we see that variable 3 must be false. So, we assign false to variable 3.

Now, we can simplify the remaining clauses:
1. (1 -2): Variable 1 is true and variable 2 is false.
2. (2 1): Variables 2 and 1 are true. This clause is satisfied.

Therefore, the solution to the SAT problem is:
- Variable 1 is true.
- Variable 2 is true.
- Variable 3 is false.

answer: 1 1 -3
