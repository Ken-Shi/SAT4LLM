To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we first need to convert the clauses into logical expressions:
1. (1 OR 3 OR NOT 2)
2. (1 OR NOT 2 OR NOT 3)
3. (3 OR NOT 2 OR 1)
4. (NOT 2 OR 1 OR 3)
5. (2 OR 1 OR NOT 3)
6. (NOT 2 OR 3 OR 1)

Now, we can analyze the clauses:
- Clauses 1, 3, and 6 have the literal 1, so we can simplify them to (1 OR ...).
- Clauses 4 and 5 have the literal 2, so we can simplify them to (... OR 2).

Therefore, the simplified logical expression is:
(1 OR 3 OR NOT 2) AND (1 OR NOT 2 OR NOT 3) AND (2 OR 1 OR NOT 3)

This expression is satisfiable because we can assign the following values:
1 = True
2 = False
3 = True

Therefore, the solution is:
answer: 1 0 -2 0 3 0
