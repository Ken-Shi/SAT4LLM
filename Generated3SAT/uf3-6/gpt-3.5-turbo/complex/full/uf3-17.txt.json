Each clause is represented as a sequence of integers ending with 0.\n\nNow, let's analyze each clause:\n1. 3 -1 -2 0: This clause is satisfied if either variable 3 is true or both variable 1 and variable 2 are false.\n2. -2 -1 -3 0: This clause is satisfied if variable 2 is false or both variable 1 and variable 3 are false.\n3. 3 -1 -2 0: This is a duplicate of the first clause.\n4. 3 -2 -1 0: This clause is satisfied if either variable 3 is true or both variable 1 and variable 2 are false.\n5. 1 -2 3 0: This clause is satisfied if either variable 1 is true or variable 2 is false or variable 3 is true.\n6. 1 3 -2 0: This clause is satisfied if either variable 1 is true or variable 3 is true or variable 2 is false.\n\nTo satisfy all clauses, we can assign the following values to variables:\n- Variable 1 = True\n- Variable 2 = False\n- Variable 3 = True\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\nanswer: 1 -2 3"
