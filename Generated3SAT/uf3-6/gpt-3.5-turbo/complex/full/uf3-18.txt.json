Now let's analyze the clauses:\n\n1. Clause: -2 -3 -1\nThis means that either variable 2 or variable 3 or variable 1 must be True.\n2. Clause: -1 2 3\nThis means that either variable 1 is False or variable 2 is True or variable 3 is True.\n3. Clause: -3 -2 -1\nThis means that either variable 3 is False or variable 2 is False or variable 1 is False.\n4. Clause: -2 3 -1\nThis means that either variable 2 is False or variable 3 is True or variable 1 is False.\n5. Clause: 3 -2 -1\nThis means that either variable 3 is True or variable 2 is False or variable 1 is False.\n6. Clause: -1 -2 -3\nThis means that either variable 1 is False or variable 2 is False or variable 3 is False.\n\nCombining the information from all the clauses, we can see that variable 1 must be False, variable 2 must be False, and variable 3 must be True in order to satisfy all the clauses.\n\nTherefore, the satisfying assignment is:\n1. Variable 1 = False\n2. Variable 2 = False\n3. Variable 3 = True\n\nanswer: -1 -2 3"
