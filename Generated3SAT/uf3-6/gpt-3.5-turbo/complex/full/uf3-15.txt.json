(B v !C v !A)\n4. (B v C v !A)\n5. (B v C v !A)\n6. (!A v C v B)\n\nNow we can try to simplify the logical statements:\n\n- From Statement 1 and Statement 3, we can see that if B is true, then both C and A must be false. So, B must be false.\n- From Statement 4, we can see that either B or C must be true, since A must be false. But since B is false, C must be true.\n- From Statement 2, since C is true, A must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the final solution is:\nA = 1\nB = 0\nC = 1\n\nanswer: A=1, B=0, C=1"
