(3 1 2) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning true to variable 3 and false to variables 1 and 2.\n2. (1 2 3) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning true to variables 1, 2, and 3.\n3. (-1 3 2) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning false to variable 1 and true to variables 3 and 2.\n4. (1 2 3) - This is a duplicate of clause 2.\n5. (1 -3 2) - This clause can be satisfied by assigning true to variables 1 and 2, and false to variable 3.\n6. (3 1 2) - This is a duplicate of clause 1.\n\nTherefore, the solution that satisfies all clauses is:\n3 = true\n2 = true\n1 = true\n\nanswer: 1=true, 2=true, 3=true"
