Let's represent the variables as x1, x2, and x3.\n\nFrom the clauses, we can interpret the conditions:\n1. x1 must be true (1) because it appears positively in clauses 1, 3, and 5\n2. x2 must be false (-2) because it appears negatively in clauses 1, 2, and 3\n3. x3 must be false (-3) because it appears negatively in clauses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6\n\nTherefore, one possible solution is:\nx1 = 1\nx2 = 0\nx3 = 0\n\nanswer: x1=1, x2=0, x3=0"
