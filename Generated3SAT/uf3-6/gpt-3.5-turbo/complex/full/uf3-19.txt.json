Translate the DIMACS format into a more readable form:\n(3, -1, -2)\n(3, -1, -2)\n(-1, 3, -2)\n(2, 1, 3)\n(-1, 3, -2)\n(-1, 3, -2)\n\n2. We can see that each line represents a clause, and the numbers represent variables. The positive number means the variable is included, and the negative number means the variable is negated.\n\n3. Now, we can try to find a satisfying assignment for the variables to make all the clauses true. This can be done by trial and error or through a more systematic approach like the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm.\n\n4. After trying different combinations, we can see that the following assignment satisfies all the clauses:\nx1 = False\nx2 = False\nx3 = True\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nanswer: x1=False, x2=False, x3=True"
