(-1 \u2228 2 \u2228 3)\n2. (2 \u2228 3 \u2228 -1)\n3. (3 \u2228 -1 \u2228 2)\n4. (2 \u2228 1 \u2228 3)\n5. (3 \u2228 1 \u2228 2)\n6. (-1 \u2228 3 \u2228 2)\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the DPLL algorithm or any other SAT solver. The clauses can be represented as follows:\n\n1. {\u00ac1, 2, 3}\n2. {2, 3, \u00ac1}\n3. {3, \u00ac1, 2}\n4. {2, 1, 3}\n5. {3, 1, 2}\n6. {\u00ac1, 3, 2}\n\nLet's try to find a satisfying assignment:\n\n1. Assigning 1 to true:\n{\u00ac1, 2, 3} => {false, 2, 3} => {2, 3}\n\n2. Assigning 2 to true:\n{2, 3, \u00ac1} => {2, 3, false} => {2, 3}\n\n3. Assigning 3 to true:\n{3, \u00ac1, 2} => {3, false, 2} => {3, 2}\n\nSo the solution is:\n- Variable 1 is false\n- Variable 2 is true\n- Variable 3 is true\n\nTherefore, the satisfying assignment is: \nanswer: 2 3 -1"
