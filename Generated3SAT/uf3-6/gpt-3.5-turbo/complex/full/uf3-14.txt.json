Similarly, the second clause, 1 2 -3 0, states that either 1 or 2 or -3 must be true.\n\nBy analyzing all the clauses, we can see that the only satisfying assignment that makes all the clauses true is when 1 is true, 2 is true, and -3 is false.\n\nTherefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:\nanswer: 1 1 0"
