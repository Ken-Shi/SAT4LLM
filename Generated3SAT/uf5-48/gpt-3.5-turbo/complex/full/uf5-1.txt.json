We can choose any of them to satisfy this clause.\n\n2. 3 -1 -5: At least one of 3, -1, or -5 must be true. We can choose 3 to satisfy this clause.\n\n3. 4 -1 3: At least one of 4, -1, or 3 must be true. We can choose 4 to satisfy this clause.\n\n4. -2 3 -1: At least one of -2, 3, or -1 must be true. We can choose -2 to satisfy this clause.\n\n5. -1 5 -2: At least one of -1, 5, or -2 must be true. We can choose 5 to satisfy this clause.\n\nBy analyzing the clauses this way, we can find a satisfying assignment for the given SAT problem.\n\nThus, the solution to the SAT problem is as follows:\n\nanswer: 3 -2 5 -1 4"
