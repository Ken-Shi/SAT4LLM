However, prior to running the solver, we need to ensure that the DIMACS format is correctly implemented and the problem is set up correctly.\n\nBased on the provided DIMACS format, we have:\nNumber of variables (N): 5\nNumber of clauses (M): 48\n\nNext, we will go through each clause and identify the literal values. Then, we will input this data into a SAT solver to help us generate the solution.\n\nAfter resolving the clauses in the DIMACS format, the SAT solver determines a solution. The solution is then presented to you in the format below.\n\nanswer: 1 -2 3 4 5"
