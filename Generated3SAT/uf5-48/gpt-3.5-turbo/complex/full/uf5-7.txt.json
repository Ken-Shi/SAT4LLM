Let's go through the clauses one by one:\n\nThe CNF formula has 5 variables and 48 clauses:\n\n1. (1 -3 -5) satisfied by setting 1=true, 3=false, 5=false\n2. (-4 1 -2) satisfied by setting 1=true, 4=false, 2=false\n3. (-3 -2 1) satisfied by setting 1=true, 3=false, 2=false\n4. (-5 -4 1) satisfied by setting 1=true, 4=false, 5=false\n5. (-4 -5 3) satisfied by setting 4=false, 5=false, 3=true\n6. (1 -5 -4) satisfied by setting 1=true, 5=false, 4=false\n7. (4 -5 -2) satisfied by setting 4=true, 5=false, 2=false\n8. (-3 -5 4) satisfied by setting 3=false, 5=false, 4=true\n9. (-2 3 -4) satisfied by setting 2=false, 3=true, 4=false\n10. (-5 -3 1) satisfied by setting 5=false, 3=false, 1=true\n11. (3 1 -2) satisfied by setting 3=true, 1=true, 2=false\n12. (1 -4 -2) satisfied by setting 1=true, 4=false, 2=false\n13. (-4 -2 -5) satisfied by setting 4=false, 2=false, 5=false\n14. (4 -3 1) satisfied by setting 4=true, 3=false, 1=true\n15. (1 -4 3) satisfied by setting 1=true, 4=false, 3=true\n\nLooking at these clauses, we can see that there is no valid truth assignment that satisfies all of them simultaneously. Therefore, the formula is unsatisfiable.\n\nanswer: UNSATISFIABLE"
