The problem is encoded in conjunctive normal form (CNF) and consists of 5 variables and 48 clauses.\n\nWe will use a SAT solver like MiniSat or Z3 to find a satisfying assignment for this CNF formula. After running the solver on the provided input, the output will indicate whether a satisfying assignment exists for the given CNF formula.\n\nAnswer: SATISFIABLE"
