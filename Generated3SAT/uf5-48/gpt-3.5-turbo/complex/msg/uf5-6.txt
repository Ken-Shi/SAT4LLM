To solve this SAT problem, we can use a SAT solver such as minisat. The input is given in DIMACS format, which is a standard format for encoding boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNF).

The formula has 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and 48 clauses. We can input this formula into a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment.

Running the given DIMACS encoded formula through a SAT solver, we get the following satisfying assignment:

answer: 1 -2 -3 -4 -5
