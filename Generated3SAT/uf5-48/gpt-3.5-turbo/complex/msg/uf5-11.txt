To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to analyze the CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) clauses provided.

The DIMACS format given has 5 variables and 48 clauses.

Here are some key steps to solve this SAT problem:

1. Convert the given DIMACS format into more readable conjunctive normal form:
   - (x1 OR NOT x4 OR x2)
   - (NOT x5 OR NOT x3 OR NOT x4)
   - (x1 OR x5 OR x2)
   - (NOT x4 OR x1 OR x3)
   - (x1 OR x2 OR NOT x3)
   - (NOT x4 OR x3 OR NOT x1)
   - (x1 OR x3 OR NOT x5)
   - (NOT x5 OR NOT x1 OR x3)
   - (x3 OR NOT x4 OR x5)
   - (x2 OR NOT x4 OR NOT x5)
   - (NOT x5 OR x2 OR x3)
   - (NOT x4 OR NOT x1 OR NOT x5)
   - ...
   (and so on for the remaining 36 clauses)

2. Apply the DPLL algorithm or other SAT-solving techniques to determine whether there exists a satisfying assignment for the given CNF formula.

After applying these steps and solving the problem, the final answer will be the solution indicating which variables need to be true (represented by positive integers) or false (represented by negative integers) for the CNF formula to be satisfied.

answer: The given SAT problem is not satisfiable.
