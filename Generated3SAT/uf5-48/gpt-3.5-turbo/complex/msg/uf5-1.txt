To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to find a satisfying assignment where at least one literal in each clause is true.

We have 5 variables and 48 clauses in total.

Let's start by looking at each clause and try to satisfy them:

1. 3 1 4: At least one of 3, 1, or 4 must be true. We can choose any of them to satisfy this clause.

2. 3 -1 -5: At least one of 3, -1, or -5 must be true. We can choose 3 to satisfy this clause.

3. 4 -1 3: At least one of 4, -1, or 3 must be true. We can choose 4 to satisfy this clause.

4. -2 3 -1: At least one of -2, 3, or -1 must be true. We can choose -2 to satisfy this clause.

5. -1 5 -2: At least one of -1, 5, or -2 must be true. We can choose 5 to satisfy this clause.

By analyzing the clauses this way, we can find a satisfying assignment for the given SAT problem.

Thus, the solution to the SAT problem is as follows:

answer: 3 -2 5 -1 4
