In this problem, we are given a SAT problem in DIMACS format with 5 variables and 48 clauses.

To solve this problem, we can use a SAT solver. However, manually solving it requires systematically trying different assignments to the variables until we find a satisfying assignment that makes all clauses true.

We can start by trying to simplify the problem. For example, we can see that clauses 1, 2, 7, 10, 25, 33, and 37 all have variable 5 and its negation in the same clause, which means those clauses can never be satisfied together. We can eliminate those clauses.

Continuing to simplify the clauses, we can notice more contradictions. For example, clauses 24 and 41 both have variables 4 and its negation in the same clause, which lead to the impossibility of those clauses being satisfied together.

We can continue eliminating pairs of clauses that contain contradictory variable assignments and attempt to simplify the problem further.

After systematically analyzing the clauses and simplifying the problem, we can arrive at a solution that satisfies all the remaining clauses.

Final solution as a single line:
answer: 1 -2 3 -4 -5
