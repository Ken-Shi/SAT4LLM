This SAT problem is in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). Each line represents a clause, and each number a literal, where negation is represented by "-" and 0 marks the end of a clause.In this problem, there are 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) and 48 clauses. 

The aim of any SAT problem is to find an assignment of these variables that makes the CNF formula true. If such an assignment doesn't exist, the formula is unsatisfiable; if it does exist, the formula is satisfiable.

A typical approach to solve this problem is the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Unit propagation: If a clause is a unit clause, i.e., it contains only a single unassigned literal, this clause can only be satisfied by assigning the necessary value to make this literal true. Thus, no choice is necessary. In human terms, if a single option remains to fulfill a constraint, there is no choice but to take it.

2. Pure literal elimination: If a propositional variable occurs with only one polarity in the formula, it is called pure. Pure literals can always be assigned in a way that makes all clauses containing them true. Thus, these clauses do not constrain the search anymore and can be deleted.

3. Splitting: If the formula ? contains no unit clauses anymore, DPLL splits ? by picking some literal l, setting its Boolean value arbitrarily, say to true.

In recursion, the DPLL algorithm is then applied again to the reduced formula. If this leads to a satisfying assignment, a satisfying assignment for the whole formula has been found. Otherwise, the same procedure is applied again but assuming that l is false.

The DPLL algorithm can be improved with a good heuristic for making decisions, and the intelligent analysis of the reasons for conflicts if the assignments lead to an unsatisfiable formula. This variant is called "Conflict-Driven Clause Learning" (CDCL) and it's the most used procedure in modern SAT solvers.

Applying the DPLL algorithm on the above problem, we get the solution:

Answer: 1 -2 -3 4 5

This means that the assignment of (1=True, 2=False, 3=False, 4=True, 5=True) will satisfy the whole formula.
