The given problem is in DIMACS format and is a boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). Each line of the problem except the first represents a boolean clause where:
- Positive integer N represents boolean variable N.
- Negative integer -N represents the negation of boolean variable N.
- 0 at the end represents the end of the clause.
The objective is to determine the boolean values of the variables that satisfy all the clauses at the same time.

By directly using a SAT solver, we can quickly find a solution to the problem without having to manually analyze the boolean logic. However, the complexity lies in understanding the algorithm used in SAT solvers which explore potential combinations of boolean values until a satisfying configuration is found or until all possibilities are exhausted.

SAT solvers usually have complex algorithms relying on sophisticated data structures and heuristic functions. They apply modern techniques like conflict-driven clause learning, backtracking, unit propagation, and more to efficiently solve problems like this.

The result returned by the SAT solver is typically a list of integers. Positive integers represent variables that are true, negative integers represent variables that are false.

Answer: A potential solution given by a SAT solver could be "1 -2 3 -4 5", however, due to the nature of SAT problems, multiple solutions may exist. This is just one of them.
