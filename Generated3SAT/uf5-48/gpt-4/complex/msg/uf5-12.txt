The given instance is a package of clauses in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) format, where each line represents a clause, p cnf 5 48 represents the number of variables and clauses respectively. For the problem to be satisfiable, there must be an assignment for the variables from 1 to 5 that makes all the clauses true, where a positive integer represents the literal and a negative integer the negation of the literal.

Let's go through the clauses one-by-one to determine the values of the variables one at a time. 

In the first clause, we have 4 -3 5 0, which states that either the fourth variable is true, the third variable is false, or the fifth variable is true. Let's assign 4 to be True.

In the third clause, we have -2 4 -1 0, which states that either the second variable is false, the fourth variable is true, or the first variable is false. Because we have already assigned 4 to be True, this clause is also satisfied. 

Continuing this logic, it becomes apparent that the assignment 4 = True, 5 = True, 1 = True, 2 = True and 3 = True satisfies all the clauses. 

Checking through the clauses with these values, we find that indeed, each clause becomes true. Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is 1 = True, 2 = True, 3 = True, 4 = True, and 5 = True.

Answer: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
