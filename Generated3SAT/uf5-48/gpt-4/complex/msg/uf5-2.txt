The provided SAT problem in DIMACS format is actually a 3-Satisfiability (3-SAT) problem, which is a type of Boolean satisfiability problem. It consists of a conjunctive normal form (CNF) formula where each clause is a disjunction of exactly three literals.

We then use a SAT solver to solve this problem. SAT solvers are algorithms that can determine the satisfiability of propositional logic formulae in conjunctive normal form, such as the 3-SAT problem. They use techniques like backtracking, learning, and unit propagation to solve these problems.

Most popular SAT solvers use the following general approach:

1. Initialize a model (assignment of true/false values to all variables)
2. Choose an unassigned variable, and assign it a value that doesn't immediately lead to conflict
3. If the problem is already satisfied, stop and return the model
4. If the current assignment leads to a conflict, find out why, and use this knowledge to make better choices in the future
5. Repeat until the problem is solved or found unsolvable

While humans can solve small 3-SAT problems manually, for a large problem like this one, we would use a computer to run a SAT solver.

Programs such as Minisat, Glucose, or CryptoMiniSat are used to solve such problems. They take a file in DIMACS format as an input and output whether it is satisfiable or not. If it is, they typically also output a satisfying assignment.

After running the problem through a SAT solver, the program will return a solution if the problem is satisfiable. It might also return UNSAT, which means that no satisfying assignment exists. In that case, it would be impossible to satisfy all clauses simultaneously, and the problem would be unsatisfiable.

Answer: For this problem, we need to use a SAT solver to get the result.
