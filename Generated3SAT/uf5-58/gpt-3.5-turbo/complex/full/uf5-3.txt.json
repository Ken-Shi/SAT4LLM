The first clause, (2 -4 -1 0), can be satisfied by setting both variables 2 and 4 to true, making variable 1 false.\n2. The second clause, (5 -1 -4 0), can be satisfied by setting variables 5 and 4 to true, making variable 1 false.\n3. The third clause, (-3 -1 2 0), can be satisfied by setting variables 3 and 2 to true, making variable 1 false.\n4. And so on...\n\nAfter going through all the clauses, we find that the following assignment satisfies all the clauses:\n\n1: False\n2: True\n3: True\n4: True\n5: True\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \nanswer: 01111"
