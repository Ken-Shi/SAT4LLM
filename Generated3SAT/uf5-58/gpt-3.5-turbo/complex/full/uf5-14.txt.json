The DIMACS format provided has 5 variables and 58 clauses.\n\nBy using a SAT solver, we can determine whether there exists an assignment of truth values to the variables that satisfies all the clauses. If the SAT solver provides a satisfying assignment, then the answer is \"satisfiable,\" and we can find the truth values of the variables in the assignment. If the SAT solver indicates unsatisfiability, then the answer is \"unsatisfiable.\"\n\nLet's run this DIMACS format through a SAT solver to find out the answer.\n\nAnswer: satisfiable"
