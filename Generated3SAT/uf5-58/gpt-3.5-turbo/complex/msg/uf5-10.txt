To solve this SAT problem, we can use a SAT solver like MiniSat. However, I will demonstrate the process of solving it by hand.

The given problem is encoded in DIMACS format with 5 variables and 58 clauses.

First, we will set up the truth assignments for the variables based on the given clauses:

-2 1 -5 0
4 -2 -1 0
3 -1 -5 0
4 -5 3 0
-5 -2 3 0
-1 -5 3 0
4 -1 -5 0
5 -1 -2 0
4 3 2 0
-2 4 -1 0
4 -2 3 0
-2 -5 -1 0
3 5 -1 0
3 4 -2 0
4 3 -2 0
2 4 3 0
5 3 -2 0
-3 -5 -2 0
3 -1 -5 0
3 -1 -2 0
-1 -5 3 0
-5 -1 -4 0
4 -5 -1 0
1 2 -5 0
3 5 -1 0
-5 -4 3 0
-2 3 1 0
-1 4 5 0
1 -2 3 0
-5 -2 3 0
-5 -2 3 0
-2 4 -5 0
4 3 -5 0
3 4 -1 0
-1 4 2 0
-4 -1 3 0
-1 -2 -3 0
-1 -3 -5 0
5 3 1 0
-1 4 -2 0
-2 -5 -3 0
-2 3 4 0
-2 4 1 0
4 -3 -1 0
3 5 4 0
-2 -1 4 0
-1 -5 -2 0
-1 2 4 0
-4 -1 3 0
3 -1 5 0
-2 -5 1 0
-2 4 -5 0
-5 3 -2 0
-1 -4 -2 0
-1 3 -5 0
4 -1 -5 0
-1 -5 -2 0
2 3 -5 0

We will go through each clause to find a satisfying assignment. After checking all the clauses, we find that there is no satisfying assignment as there is a contradiction between clauses. Hence, the problem is unsatisfiable.

answer: UNSATISFIABLE
