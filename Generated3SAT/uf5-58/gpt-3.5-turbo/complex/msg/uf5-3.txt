To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use a SAT solver or attempt to manually find a satisfying assignment by examining the clauses.

Let's examine the clauses:

1. The first clause, (2 -4 -1 0), can be satisfied by setting both variables 2 and 4 to true, making variable 1 false.
2. The second clause, (5 -1 -4 0), can be satisfied by setting variables 5 and 4 to true, making variable 1 false.
3. The third clause, (-3 -1 2 0), can be satisfied by setting variables 3 and 2 to true, making variable 1 false.
4. And so on...

After going through all the clauses, we find that the following assignment satisfies all the clauses:

1: False
2: True
3: True
4: True
5: True

Therefore, the final answer is: 
answer: 01111
