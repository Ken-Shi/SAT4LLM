                "content": "This problem is represented in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), suitable for SAT solvers. It\u2019s a boolean satisfiability problem. Every clause is a disjunction of literals (a variable or its negation), and the entire problem is a conjunction (AND) of these clauses. \n\nIn a CNF problem, when we see a positive number, this represents a variable that needs to be \"True\" to satisfy the clause and a negative number represents a variable that needs to be \"False\" to satisfy the clause. \n\n1. To solve, we first need to identify all unique variables, which are: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. \n2. We then proceed to check individual clauses and try values of these variables that make the clause True. \n3. If a clause contains three variables (e.g. -2 -1 -4), none of which are negated, then this clause can be satisfied by setting all three variables to True.\n4. If a clause contains a variable and its negation (e.g. -1 3 -2 0 2), then this clause can be satisfied by setting the variable to True and its negation to False. \n\nLet's randomly start with 1 set to False. Looking at rest of clauses, to satisfy \"3 -1 -4\" we can set 3 to True and 4 to False. Moving to next clause \"5 -2 -4\", we should set 5 to True because 2 and 4 are False. To satisfy \"-2 5 -1\", we shouldn't change the values since the clause is already satisfied. Eventually, going through all clauses, we may need to backtrack and try a different initial assignment because we got stuck at some clauses like \"-4 1 5\" which cannot be satisfied given current assignments. Backtracking and trying 1 set to True leads to a satisfying assignment for all clauses. This problem-solving approach is similar to what a SAT solver will do.\n\nNote that SAT is NP-complete, so we may have to backtrack and try different assignments several times, especially for problems with large numbers of variables and clauses. For complex problems, it's infeasible to try all possible assignments of variables, so it needs a lot of heuristic methods or approximation algorithms.\n\nAnswer: 1=True, 2=False, 3=True, 4=False, 5=True."
