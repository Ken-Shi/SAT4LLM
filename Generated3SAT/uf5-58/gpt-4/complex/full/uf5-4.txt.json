                "content": "To solve the SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, I will use a method known as the DPLL algorithm. \n\nThe DPLL algorithm involves systematically trying out assignments for each variable to see whether it would lead to a solution. The algorithm steps include:\n\n1. Check if the formula is either in solved form (Solution found) or unsolvable (No Solution).\n2. If not, pick an unassigned variable.\n3. Try assigning a value (true or false) to this variable and simplify the expression.\n4. Recursively run DPLL algorithm on the simplified expression.\n5. If the recursive call returns a solution, return this solution.\n6. If the recursive call fails, try the opposite value assignment (true becomes false and vice versa) and run DPLL algorithm again.\n7. If this recursive call returns a solution, return this solution. If it fails, undo the variable assignment and return failure.\n\nApplying DPLL algorithm on given SAT problem and simplifying clauses, we get:\n\nx1 = true, x2 = true, x3 = true, x4 = true, x5 = true\n\n**Answer:**\nThe solution for the SAT problem is 1 2 3 4 5"
