The provided problem is a SAT problem represented in DIMACS format, which is commonly used for representing CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) formulas. The first line in the problem represents the problem metadata where 'p' denotes problem, 'cnf' denotes Conjunctive Normal Form, '5' is the maximum variable id and '58' is the number of clauses in the formula.

Each succeeding line represents a clause in the formula where each clause is a disjunction (OR operation) of literals and ends with a zero. A positive number denotes a literal whereas a negative number denotes the negation of a literal. Ex. '1 2 4 0' means '1 OR 2 OR 4'.

To solve the SAT problem, we can use a SAT solver or manually try to find a satisfying solution. SAT problem is NP-complete, finding a manual solution might not be efficient for large problems. However, since this problem is small, a manual approach can work.

Let's start:

1) -5 -3 2 0 and 3 -5 1 0 - 
   If we set 5 to false, 3 is either true or false, therefore, 2 and 1 must both be true for the clauses to be satisfied.
   
2) 1 -4 2 0 - 
   If we set 1 to true, then 2 is irrelevant, meaning 4 can either be true or false.

3) -3 -4 -5 0 - 
   If we set 3 to false, and we already know that 5 is already false, then 4 must be false too.

4) Checking the remaining clauses, no contradictions are found with the current true/false assignment.

So, a potential solution could be:

Answer: In DIMACS format, an example of a satisfied solution would be:
1 -2 3 -4 -5
