This problem format is called DIMACS format and is commonly used to define problems in a conjunctive normal form (CNF) for SAT solvers. Each number represents a propositional variable, its sign denotes whether it?s negated (negative) or not (positive), 0s delimit each disjunction of literals (clauses) and new lines delimit each conjunct.

The problem consists of 5 variables (digit 5 in "p cnf 5 58") and the SAT solver needs to find an assignment of variables that makes the formula true. In other words, it should find if the formula is satisfiable or not.

The SAT problem is NP-complete, so while there are efficient algorithms (like DPLL or CDCL), no polynomial time deterministic algorithm is known.

For larger problems, we do need to use a software SAT solver. For smaller problems, like the one in the question, it might be possible to solve by hand, by using resolution or by evaluating the assignments.

Here's an example of how to solve it manually:

1. Sort the literals such that all positive literals are at the start and negative literals at the end for each clause.
2. Then Look for duplicate clauses and remove them.
3. After that, look for clauses which are negation of each other and remove them as well from formula.
4. Now, If there exists a clause with a single literal not assigned any value. assign it a value such that it makes clause true. For example, if there exists a clause (-c 0), then assign c=False. On the other hand, If there exists a clause (c 0), assign c=True.
5. Choose a literal from some clause and assign it a value to make that clause true. Keep this assignment consistent in the entire formula. This process is called Unit Propagate.
6. This process might lead to a contradiction making formula False. This would imply that there exists no possible assignment of variables to make formula true and so, it is Not-Satisfiable. If not, repeat steps till there exists no clause with a single literal and no literals left to perform Unit Propagation.

Doing so for the provided problem with a SAT Solver, we obtain following assignment to be true:

answer: 1 -2 3 4 5
