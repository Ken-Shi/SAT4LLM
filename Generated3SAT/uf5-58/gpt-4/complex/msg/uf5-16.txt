The given problem is a 3-SAT problem which is encoded in DIMACS format. The DIMACS Format is a standard for specifying problems from various combinatorial families in a uniform way. For the given problem, it begins with a line 'p cnf 5 58'. Here, 'p' signifies problem, 'cnf' signifies conjunctive normal form(3-SAT problem), '5' is the number of variables and '58' is the number of clauses. Each line following the first one signifies a clause of the 3-SAT-disjunction, where each circle (an integer from 1 to 5 or its negation) is separated by a whitespace and the disjunction is indicated by a '0' at the end of each line. 

To solve 3-SAT problem, we can use a method such as the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm or algorithms based on stochastic local search. Here, I'm trying to find a satisfiability solution by a bruteforce method:

By trial and error, starting with random initial assignment and examining each clause, to make sure almost every clause has at least one true literal in it. If not, flip the assignment of some variable in the clause. Repeat this till we find an assignment that makes all clauses true or all possibilities are checked.

After doing the trial and error by checking all possible combinations, the simplified form of your given 3-SAT disjunctions turns out to be easily satisfied with the following variables' values:

answer: {1=-1, 2=-1, 3=1, 4=-1, 5=1}

Negative integers represent False while the positive integers represent True. For example, 1=-1 means the variable 1 is False.
