To solve the SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, I will use a method known as the DPLL algorithm. 

The DPLL algorithm involves systematically trying out assignments for each variable to see whether it would lead to a solution. The algorithm steps include:

1. Check if the formula is either in solved form (Solution found) or unsolvable (No Solution).
2. If not, pick an unassigned variable.
3. Try assigning a value (true or false) to this variable and simplify the expression.
4. Recursively run DPLL algorithm on the simplified expression.
5. If the recursive call returns a solution, return this solution.
6. If the recursive call fails, try the opposite value assignment (true becomes false and vice versa) and run DPLL algorithm again.
7. If this recursive call returns a solution, return this solution. If it fails, undo the variable assignment and return failure.

Applying DPLL algorithm on given SAT problem and simplifying clauses, we get:

x1 = true, x2 = true, x3 = true, x4 = true, x5 = true

**Answer:**
The solution for the SAT problem is 1 2 3 4 5
