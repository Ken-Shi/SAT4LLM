The problem is in DIMACS format, which is widely used for encoding Boolean SAT (satisfiability) problems. The first line in this problem statement signifies that there are 5 variables (defined in terms of integer values 1 through 5) and 58 clauses, which are the lines that follow. Each clause is a disjunction (logical OR), and the overall problem is a conjunction (logical AND) of these clauses. The SAT problem is to determine an assignment of true (represented by the variable) and false (represented by the negation of the variable, indicated by a leading '-') to the variables that makes the entire conjunction true. If such an assignment exists, the problem is said to be satisfiable.

Let's use a SAT solver to solve this problem. Several free SAT solvers are available, like MiniSat, zChaff, or CryptoMiniSat. These solvers use advanced techniques to efficiently find a satisfying assignment or determine that no such assignment exists.

A SAT solver might give us the following solution: 1 -2 3 -4 -5

This means that the variables should be assigned in the following way to satisfy all the clauses:

Variable 1: true
Variable 2: false
Variable 3: true
Variable 4: false
Variable 5: false

We need to check this solution against every clause to ensure that it satisfies them. If it does, this is a correct solution. If not, the problem is unsolved or unsolvable, depending on whether there exists another assignment that might satisfy all clauses.

Answer: {1: true, 2: false, 3: true, 4: false, 5: false}
