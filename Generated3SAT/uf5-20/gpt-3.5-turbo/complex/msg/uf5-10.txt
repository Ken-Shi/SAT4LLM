To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to find a satisfying assignment that makes the conjunction of all clauses true.

The problem has 5 variables and 20 clauses. Let's analyze the clauses step by step:

- We start by looking at clause 1: -5 1 4. To satisfy this clause, we must make either variable 1 or variable 4 true. Since -5 is also in the clause, we cannot choose variable 5. We will choose variable 1 to satisfy this clause.

- Next, we look at clause 2: 1 -3 -2. Variable 1 is already true from the previous step, so this clause is already satisfied.

- Continuing this process for all clauses, we have:
Clause 3: -5 3 4 (already satisfied)
Clause 4: -2 -4 1 (already satisfied)
Clause 5: 4 1 -5 (already satisfied)
Clause 6: -5 3 1 (already satisfied)
Clause 7: -3 2 5 (satisfy by choosing variable 2)

The satisfying assignment we have so far is: 1, 2.

Going on to satisfy the remaining clauses, we have:
Clause 9: -3 1 -2 (satisfied)
Clause 10: 5 -2 -3 (satisfied)
Clause 11: -5 4 1 (satisfied)
Clause 12: -5 4 -1 (satisfy by choosing variable -1 - which means not choosing variable 1)
Clause 13: 1 4 -5 (satisfied)
Clause 14: -2 4 1 (satisfied)
Clause 15: 4 -2 -3 (satisfied)
Clause 16: -2 -3 -4 (satisfy by choosing variable -4)
Clause 17: 1 -5 -3 (satisfied)
Clause 18: -2 4 5 (satisfied)
Clause 19: -4 1 -5 (satisfied)
Clause 20: -4 -5 1 (satisfy by choosing variable -4)

The final satisfying assignment is: 2, -1, -4.

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: 2, -1, -4.
