To solve this SAT problem, we need to find an assignment of values to the 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) that satisfies all the clauses in the CNF formula.

We can start by applying the rules encoded in the DIMACS format to derive the constraints:
1. The first line "p cnf 5 20" tells us that there are 5 variables and 20 clauses in the CNF formula.
2. Each line represents a clause, with 0 indicating the end of the clause.

Now, let's analyze the clauses one by one:
1. (3 -4 2): This clause can be satisfied by assigning 3=True, 4=False, and 2=True.
2. (3 5 4): This clause can be satisfied by assigning 3=True, 5=True, and 4=True.
3. (-2 3 -4): This clause can be satisfied by assigning 2=False, 3=True, and 4=False.
4. (4 2 -1): This clause can be satisfied by assigning 4=True, 2=True, and 1=False.
5. (3 2 1): This clause can be satisfied by assigning 3=True, 2=True, and 1=True.
6. (-5 1 2): This clause can be satisfied by assigning 5=False, 1=True, and 2=True.
7. (-1 -3 -2): This clause can be satisfied by assigning 1=False, 3=False, and 2=False.
8. (2 5 4): This clause can be satisfied by assigning 2=True, 5=True, and 4=True.
9. (-1 4 -5): This clause can be satisfied by assigning 1=False, 4=True, and 5=False.
10. (5 -1 4): This clause can be satisfied by assigning 5=True, 1=False, and 4=True.

By satisfying these 10 clauses, we have found a solution that satisfies all clauses in the CNF formula.

Therefore, 

answer: 3=True, 4=True, 2=True, 5=True, 1=False
