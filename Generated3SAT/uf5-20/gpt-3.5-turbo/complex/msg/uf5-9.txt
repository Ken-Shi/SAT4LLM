To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use the following clauses:

1. 2 -1 4 0
2. 4 -5 2 0
3. -5 2 3 0
4. 2 4 -1 0
5. 3 -2 -5 0
6. 4 3 2 0
7. -4 -1 -5 0
8. -5 3 -1 0
9. -5 2 -4 0
10. 4 -1 -3 0
11. 2 -5 3 0
12. 3 -5 -1 0
13. -2 -5 4 0
14. 3 -1 -5 0
15. 2 4 -5 0
16. 3 -2 4 0
17. -2 5 4 0
18. 4 1 3 0
19. 4 3 2 0
20. -3 -1 -5 0

Now, let's work through the clauses to determine a logical assignment that satisfies all of them.

From clause 1, we have either 2 or 4. We choose 2.
From clause 4, we have either 2 or 4. We already have 2, so this clause is satisfied.
From clause 7, we have either -4, -1, or -5. We choose -1.
From clause 14, we have either 3, -1, or -5. We choose 3.
From clause 16, we have either 3 or -2. We already have 3, so this clause is satisfied.
From clause 18, we have either 4, 1, or 3. We choose 1.

Therefore, the logical assignment that satisfies all the clauses is: 
-1, 2, 3, -4, 1

answer: -1, 2, 3, -4, 1
