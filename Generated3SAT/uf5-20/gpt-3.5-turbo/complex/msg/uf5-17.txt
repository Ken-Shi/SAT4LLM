To solve this SAT problem, we can start by analyzing the given clauses in the DIMACS format:

1. -4 -1 -5 0
2. 1 2 4 0
3. -1 -3 2 0
4. 5 -2 3 0
5. 4 -5 2 0
6. -5 4 2 0
7. -5 3 -1 0
8. 3 2 -5 0
9. -1 2 4 0
10. -5 4 -1 0
11. 4 -5 -3 0
12. 2 4 -1 0
13. 3 -1 4 0
14. 3 -1 -4 0
15. 3 -2 -1 0
16. 5 3 -4 0
17. -5 -1 3 0
18. 3 2 4 0
19. 4 3 1 0
20. 4 -5 3 0

We can now try to simplify the problem by eliminating redundant or contradictory clauses. After simplifying, we find that:

5. 4 -5 2 0
6. -5 4 2 0
10. -5 4 -1 0
11. 4 -5 -3 0
20. 4 -5 3 0

From clauses 5 and 6, we see that 4 must be True.
From clauses 10 and 11, we see that -5 must be True.
From clause 11, since 4 and -5 are True, -3 must be True.

Therefore, the solution to the SAT problem is as follows:

answer: 4, -5, -3
