To solve this SAT problem, we can use a SAT solver such as MiniSat or Z3. However, since we need to solve it manually, we can go through the DIMACS format and try to find a satisfying assignment.

The DIMACS format indicates a 5 variable problem with 20 clauses.

Let's interpret the clauses:
1. (3 4 -2)
2. (-1 -3 4)
3. (4 -1 -3)
4. (2 4 3)
5. (-4 5 -3)
6. (2 -1 5)
7. (5 4 2)
8. (-1 4 2)
9. (5 -1 4)
10. (-1 4 5)
11. (5 3 -1)
12. (3 2 4)
13. (4 5 3)
14. (5 4 2)
15. (4 3 1)
16. (4 3 2)
17. (5 -1 -4)
18. (-1 4 3)
19. (-2 4 1)
20. (2 -3 4)

Now, let's try to find an assignment that satisfies all clauses. We will use trial and error to find a solution that satisfies all clauses.

Starting with the first clause:
(3 4 -2)
Assigning 3 = true, 4 = true, and 2 = false satisfies the first clause.

Continuing in this manner, we find a satisfying assignment:
1 = false
2 = false
3 = true
4 = true
5 = true

Therefore, the solution is:
answer: 0 0 1 1 1
