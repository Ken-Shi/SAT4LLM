To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to find a satisfying assignment that makes the conjunction of all clauses true.

Here are the clauses in the DIMACS format:
-4 1 -2 0
1 -3 5 0
1 -3 4 0
5 1 -2 0
1 -3 5 0
2 1 4 0
2 5 -3 0
1 2 4 0
4 -3 2 0
5 1 -3 0
2 -1 -4 0
3 1 5 0
2 4 5 0
5 1 2 0
4 5 -3 0
2 -3 1 0
-3 2 4 0
5 -3 1 0
-1 5 -2 0
-2 -3 1 0

To simplify the given clauses, we can eliminate redundant clauses and derive the following set of simplified clauses:
1 -3 5
2 4 5
5 -3 1

Now, let's try to find a satisfying assignment:

From the first clause, we can assign:
-4 = False
1 = True 
-2 = False

From the second clause:
3 = False because -3 is already assigned 

From the third clause:
4 = True

From the fourth clause:
2 = True
5 = True

Final assignment:
-4 = False
1 = True
-2 = False
3 = False
4 = True
2 = True
5 = True

Therefore, the satisfying assignment is:
1 = True, 2 = True, 3 = False, 4 = True, 5 = True

Answer: 1 = True, 2 = True, 3 = False, 4 = True, 5 = True
