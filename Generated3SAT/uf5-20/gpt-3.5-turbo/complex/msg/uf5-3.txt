To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment. The DIMACS format specifies the problem as a SAT instance represented in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), with 5 variables and 20 clauses.

Our goal is to find an assignment of truth values to the 5 variables (labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) that satisfies all 20 clauses given in the DIMACS format.

Let's input the DIMACS format into a SAT solver to get the solution.

**Answer:** 
The satisfying assignment that solves the SAT problem is:
1 = False
2 = False
3 = False
4 = True
5 = False
