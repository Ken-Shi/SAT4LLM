To solve this SAT problem, we will first convert the given DIMACS format into a more readable form:

1. (2 OR 4 OR 3)
2. (4 OR -2 OR 5)
3. (5 OR -1 OR 2)
4. (3 OR 4 OR 5)
5. (-1 OR 3 OR 4)
6. (5 OR 4 OR 2)
7. (-5 OR 2 OR 3)
8. (5 OR 2 OR 3)
9. (-4 OR 2 OR 5)
10. (5 OR 4 OR 1)
11. (-1 OR 3 OR -4)
12. (2 OR 4 OR -1)
13. (3 OR 2 OR 4)
14. (2 OR 1 OR 4)
15. (-1 OR 3 OR 5)
16. (5 OR 2 OR -4)
17. (1 OR 3 OR -4)
18. (2 OR -1 OR -5)
19. (2 OR -1 OR -5)

The goal is to find values for variables 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 such that the CNF formula is satisfied.

We can start by considering each clause one by one and trying to find a possible assignment that satisfies the clause. If all clauses are satisfied, we have found a solution.

1. (2 OR 4 OR 3) - Let's choose values 2, 4, and 3 to be True.
2. (4 OR -2 OR 5) - Already satisfied since 4 is True.
3. (5 OR -1 OR 2) - Already satisfied since 5 is True.
4. (3 OR 4 OR 5) - Already satisfied since 3, 4, and 5 are True.
5. (-1 OR 3 OR 4) - Already satisfied since 3 and 4 are True.
6. (5 OR 4 OR 2) - Already satisfied since 5 and 4 are True.
7. (-5 OR 2 OR 3) - Already satisfied since 2 and 3 are True.
8. (5 OR 2 OR 3) - Already satisfied since 5, 2, and 3 are True.
9. (-4 OR 2 OR 5) - Already satisfied since 2 and 5 are True.
10. (5 OR 4 OR 1) - Let's choose value 1 to be True.
11. (-1 OR 3 OR -4) - Let's choose value -4 to be True.
12. (2 OR 4 OR -1) - Already satisfied since 4 and 2 are True.
13. (3 OR 2 OR 4) - Already satisfied since 3, 2, and 4 are True.
14. (2 OR 1 OR 4) - Already satisfied since 4, 2, and 1 are True.
15. (-1 OR 3 OR 5) - Already satisfied since 3 and 5 are True.
16. (5 OR 2 OR -4) - Already satisfied since 5 and 2 are True.
17. (1 OR 3 OR -4) - Already satisfied since 1 and 3 are True.
18. (2 OR -1 OR -5) - Already satisfied since 2 is True.
19. (2 OR -1 OR -5) - Already satisfied since 2 is True.

Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:
answer: 2 4 3 5 1
