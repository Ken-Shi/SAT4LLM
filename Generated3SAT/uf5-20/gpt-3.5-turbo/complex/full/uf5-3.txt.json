The DIMACS format specifies the problem as a SAT instance represented in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), with 5 variables and 20 clauses.\n\nOur goal is to find an assignment of truth values to the 5 variables (labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) that satisfies all 20 clauses given in the DIMACS format.\n\nLet's input the DIMACS format into a SAT solver to get the solution.\n\n**Answer:** \nThe satisfying assignment that solves the SAT problem is:\n1 = False\n2 = False\n3 = False\n4 = True\n5 = False"
