A or not E or B\n2. B or not A or C\n3. B or C or not A\n4. D or E or B\n5. B or not A or D\n6. B or not E or not A\n7. not A or B or not D\n8. C or B or D\n9. not E or not A or D\n10. C or not A or D\n11. not D or B or not E\n12. C or B or not E\n13. C or not A or not E\n14. D or not E or not A\n15. C or D or not E\n16. A or B or C\n17. B or not A or not E\n18. not A or C or not D\n19. B or C or D\n20. D or not E or C\n\nAnalyzing the logical deductions based on the clauses, we can see that the following assignments satisfy all clauses:\n\nA = False\nB = True\nC = True\nD = True\nE = False\n\nTherefore, the solution to the SAT problem is:\nanswer: -1 2 3 4 -5"
