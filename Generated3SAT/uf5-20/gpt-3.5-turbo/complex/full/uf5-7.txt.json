Each clause has 3 literals.\n\nLet's start by looking at the clauses one by one:\n\n1. (1, -5, 2) - We can satisfy this by setting 1 = True, 5 = False, and 2 = True.\n2. (4, -5, -3) - We can satisfy this by setting 4 = True, 5 = False, and 3 = False.\n3. (-3, 1, 4) - We can satisfy this by setting 3 = False, 1 = True, and 4 = True.\n4. (2, -5, -3) - We can satisfy this by setting 2 = True, 5 = False, and 3 = False.\n5. (-1, -3, -5) - We can satisfy this by setting 1 = False, 3 = False, and 5 = False.\n6. (-5, -3, 4) - We can satisfy this by setting 5 = False, 3 = False, and 4 = True.\n7. (-3, -2, -5) - We can satisfy this by setting 3 = False, 2 = False, and 5 = False.\n8. (2, -3, 1) - We can satisfy this by setting 2 = True, 3 = False, and 1 = True.\n9. (1, 2, 4) - We can satisfy this by setting 1 = True, 2 = True, and 4 = True.\n10. (-3, -5, 1) - We can satisfy this by setting 3 = False, 5 = False, and 1 = True.\n11. (2, 3, -5) - We can satisfy this by setting 2 = True, 3 = True, and 5 = False.\n12. (1, -3, 4) - We can satisfy this by setting 1 = True, 3 = False, and 4 = True.\n13. (1, 4, -5) - We can satisfy this by setting 1 = True, 4 = True, and 5 = False.\n14. (2, -3, -5) - We can satisfy this by setting 2 = True, 3 = False, and 5 = False.\n15. (1, -3, 2) - We can satisfy this by setting 1 = True, 3 = False, and 2 = True.\n16. (-5, 2, 1) - We can satisfy this by setting 5 = False, 2 = True, and 1 = True.\n17. (3, 4, 2) - We can satisfy this by setting 3 = True, 4 = True, and 2 = True.\n18. (-1, -2, -3) - We can satisfy this by setting 1 = False, 2 = False, and 3 = False.\n19. (4, 1, 3) - We can satisfy this by setting 4 = True, 1 = True, and 3 = True.\n20. (-5, 1, -3) - We can satisfy this by setting 5 = False, 1 = True, and 3 = False.\n\nTherefore, the satisfying assignment for this SAT problem is:\n1 = True\n2 = True\n3 = False\n4 = True\n5 = False\n\nFinal answer: answer: 1 2 -3 4 -5"
