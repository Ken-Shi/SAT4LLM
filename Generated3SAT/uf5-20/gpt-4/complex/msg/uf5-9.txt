This SAT problem has various clauses that contradicts each other, hence it cannot be solved. Such situations take place in real SAT problems as well. Now let's look at a few lines for example:

2 -1 4 0
4 -5 2 0
-5 2 3 0

We can observe that in the first line, 2 and 4 are stated as true but in the next line, -5 i.e. 5 should be false, is stated like it might be true as well as 2 is true which again in the third line contradicts with it being true or false. Hence, the truth values cannot be unequivocally established for these variables. 

Therefore, there seems to be no logical or consistent way to get a solution. 

Answer: UNSOLVABLE.
