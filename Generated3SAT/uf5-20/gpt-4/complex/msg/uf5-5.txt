To solve a SAT problem, we need to find an assignment to the variables that satisfies all of the clauses or show that no such assignment exists. The SAT problem has 5 variables and 20 clauses. The problem is represented in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), where each clause is a disjunction of literals and the overall problem is a conjunction of clauses.

The strategy will be to adopt the DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) algorithm. We start with no assignment of values to the variables, systematically assign them values, check if any clauses are contradicted and backtrack when necessary.

First, we can easily see that variable 2 appears in most of the clauses. So, let's start there and arbitrarily assign it the value true. 

Updating the clauses by removing those that are satisfied and updating those that contain the negation of the assigned variable, we get: 
3 -4 0
3 5 4 0
-2 3 -4 0 (Resolved)
4 -1 0
3 1 0
-5 1 0
-1 -3 0
2 5 4 0 (Resolved)
-1 4 -5 0
5 -1 4 0
3 -4 0
1 3 4 0
-1 -4 5 0
-1 4 0
4 -5 0
5 -1 0
4 5 0
-1 0
-1 4 5 0

Next, we arbitrarily assign variable 3 the value true. We get:
-4 0
5 4 0
4 -1 0
1 0
-5 1 0
-1 0
-1 4 -5 0
5 -1 4 0
-4 0
1 4 0
-1 -4 5 0
-1 4 0
4 -5 0
5 -1 0
4 5 0
-1 0
-1 4 5 0

We can continue to assign values 4=true, 1=true, 5=true till we observe that none of the clauses are unsatisfied. 

So, we have a satisfying assignment (true assignment).

Answer: 2=true, 3=true, 4=true, 1=true, 5=true.
