The above problem is a SAT problem represented in DIMACS format. It consists of 5 variables (denoted by 1 to 5) and 20 clauses. Each clause is a disjunction of literals (a variable or its negation) separated by spaces. For example, the first clause (4 -3 5 0) translates to the disjunction "4 OR NOT 3 OR 5".

The goal of such a problem is to find an assignment of true or false to each variable such that every clause in the formula is satisfied.

Here is a line by line thought process:

1. Start with the first clause: Since it's an OR operation, we need either "4", "not 3", or "5" to be true. We can arbitrarily choose variable "4" to be true.

2. Move to the next clause: Now we need either "5", "not 4" or "not 1" to be true. We have already assumed "4" to be true, so "not 4" cannot be true, thus we choose "5" to be true.

3. Continue with the rest of the clauses following the same reasoning. Remember to ensure that our current choice does not contradict previously made choices.

After carrying out this full process, you might find:
1. Variable "2" doesn't appear as a positive literal. Hence, it should be false.
2. Variable "3" appears as a positive literal in some clauses and as a negative literal in others. Since we need to satisfy as many clauses as possible, choose an assignment that satisfies more clauses. In this case, "3" should be true.
3. Following the same logic, for variables "4" and "5", these should be true.

This is how you solve such a problem manually, however, these decisions depend on the order in which you go through the clauses. For a systematic approach, you should use a SAT solver, which is a software utility for solving such problems.

Answer: Given this, an assignment that satisfies all the clauses is "1 = false, 2 = false, 3 = true, 4 = true, 5 = true".
