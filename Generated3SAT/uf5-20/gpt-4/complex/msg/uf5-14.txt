The SAT problem is a boolean satisfiability problem which is determining if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given boolean formula. The problem takes a list of clauses and each clause is a disjunction of literals. A literal is either a variable or a negation of variable and a clause will be true if at least one literal is true. If all the clauses are true then the formula is true and the problem is satisfiable. 

From the given problem, there are 5 variables (1,2,3,4,5) and 20 clauses which are represented in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). 

The first step in solving the SAT problem is understanding the DIMACS format:
- "p cnf 5 20" means that we are dealing with a problem in conjunctive normal form (cnf), with 5 variables and 20 clauses.
- The rest of the rows represent the clauses, where a "0" marks the end of a single clause and negative numbers represent negated variables.

Now let's solve the problem:

Looking at the clauses, it seems like 5 and 2 appear in almost every clause, often in positive form. Starting with these being True will likely to satisfy many clauses:

1. Start with 5=True,2=True.
2. Now observe first and second clauses, the third literal in them which is 3 or -2, either will have to be True. Let's set 3=True.
3. Observing clause 5, -1, it has to be False. So 1=False.
4. Now looking at the 10th clause 5 4 1 0, even though 5 and 1 are set, the whole clause will not become True unless 4=True, let?s assign 4=True.

Now lets check if this assignment (5=True, 2=True, 3=True, 1=False, 4=True) satisfies all the clauses.

It turns out that our guess satisfies all the clauses, so this is a satisfying assignment.

Answer: 5=True, 2=True, 3=True, 1=False, 4=True
