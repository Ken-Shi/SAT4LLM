The provided problem is a SAT (Satisfiability) problem, which is an instance of the Boolean satisfiability problem (also known as the propositional satisfiability problem and abbreviated as SATISFIABILITY or SAT). The SAT problem is a decision problem, whose instance is a boolean expression written using only AND, OR, NOT, variables, and parentheses. The question is: given the expression, is there some assignment of TRUE and FALSE values to the variables that will make the entire expression true?

The input is given in DIMACS file format, which is often used as a standard way to encode and describe instances of combinatorial problems for use in benchmarking, for example for the SAT competition.

Each line of the content after the first one represents a different clause of the expression, with each number representing a different variable. A positive number means the variable should be TRUE to satisfy the clause, and a negative number means the variable should be FALSE to satisfy the clause. A line ending in 0 merely indicates the end of a particular clause.

Let's solve this step by step:

Assuming 5 to be True and considering the first line " -2 4 5 0 ", since 5 is True, the whole clause will be true. 

Line 2, " -2 -3 5 0 ", indicates that 5 needs to be True for the clause to be satisfied, and since we have assumed 5 as True, this clause will also be satisfied. 

Following in this manner, assuming 2 as False, 1 as True, 3 as False and 4 as True. We can see that these assumptions will satisfy all the clauses.

So, the Boolean assignment that will make the entire expression true is:

{1 = true, 2 = false, 3 = false, 4 = true, 5 = true}

Answer: 1 -2 -3 4 5
