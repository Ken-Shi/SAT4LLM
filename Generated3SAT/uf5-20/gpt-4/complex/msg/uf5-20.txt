The idea of satisfiability problems is that you're looking to find an assignment of true/false values to a set of variables that makes a series of logical statements true. 

Each line in the provided input represents a clause (or rule) in conjunctive normal form. The line "p cnf 5 20", for instance, is a header providing the problem's format, the number of variables (5), and the number of clauses (20).

The numbers before zeros in other lines represent variables if they are positive and their negation if they are negative. A line ending in zero is a logical disjunction: if any of the conditions inside it hold true, then the whole line evaluates as True. Each line stands for a clause in the problem.

For instance, the line "2 -4 3 0" means that either variable 2 is true, variable 4 is false, or variable 3 is true (or any combination of these conditions).

The real trick in solving these problems is finding assignments that satisfy all constraints simultaneously.

The solution process runs as follows:

1) Start by examining each clause to see if any can be satisfied with the current truth assignment. 

2) If a clause is found which needs 'flip', the variable that occurs most frequently in the unsatisfied clauses is flipped. 

3) Repeat process from step (1) until either the formula is satisfied (an assignment is found) or no variable occurs in the unsatisfied clauses more than once.

With using the above algorithm to such a problem, we can conclude the solution of the problem is the following truth assignment:

Answer: {1=true, 2=true, 3=true, 4=false, 5=false}
