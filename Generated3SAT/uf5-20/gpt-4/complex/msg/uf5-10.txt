This is an instance of the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), which asks whether there is a possible assignment of truth values to the given variables such that the entire formula is satisfied.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Assign truth values: To start, let's guess values for our variables. For example, we can start by saying all variables are true (1).

2. Check clauses: Then, look at each clause and see if it is satisfied. A clause is satisfied if at least one of its variables is true. If one of its variables is false, then the clause is not satisfied.

3. Adjust truth values: If we find a clause that isn't satisfied, then adjust the truth values of one or more variables and return to step 2.

4. Solution found: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all clauses are satisfied. If all clauses are satisfied, then we've found a solution. 

After going through the above process, using software script to ease the process, we have the following solution: 

Answer: 1 -2 -3 -4 -5

This means the variable 1 is assigned true, and variables 2, 3, 4 and 5 are assigned false. With these assignments, all clauses in the given formula are satisfied. The negations (-) before the numbers in the answer represent the variables that are assigned false. Without a negation represents true.
