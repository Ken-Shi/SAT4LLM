The format you have provided is known as DIMACS format; it is a standard format for SAT problems. Each line represents a clause, zero denotes the end of a clause, and variables can be denoted positively or negatively (the negative implies taking the negation of that variable).

First, consider all positive literals in the problem and try to avoid contradictions. By mapping the literal to true or false, we can evaluate the clauses. If any clause has at least one literal with 'true' then the clause will be 'true'. The process continues until we either satisfy all the clauses, or we encounter a contradiction.

Here's how you solve it:

1. Avoiding contradictions and considering positive literals, you can expect the following formation:
    Variables: 1=T, 2=T, 3=T, 4=T, 5=F

2. Now, we verify each clause with these variable assignments:

   1 -5 2 0 evaluates to T T T -> T (satisfied)
   4 -5 -3 0 evaluates to T T F -> T (satisfied)
   -3 1 4 0 evaluates to F T T -> T (satisfied)
   .
   .
   .
   Etc. Following through all 20 clauses leads to all of them being satisfied.

So, the assigned literals satisfy all the clauses in the problem, and can therefore be considered a solution.

Answer:
1=T, 2=T, 3=T, 4=T, 5=F
