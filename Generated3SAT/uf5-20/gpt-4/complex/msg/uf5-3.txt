This is a SAT problem in CNF (conjunctive normal form) where we have to look for a variable assignment that satisfies all the clauses. Each clause can be either true or false. If any one literal (variable or its negation) in a clause is true, then the clause it is in is true. All clauses must be true to satisfy the formulation.

The variables here are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. They can take the value of either true or false, represented by a respective positive or negative number.

There are 20 clauses we have to satisfy. Amongst the clauses, some contractions can be detected, such as (4,3,2) and (-4,-3,-2) indicating that these three variables cannot be all true or all false at the same time. These contractions have to be taken account while finding the solution.

We look for a solution using a SAT solver. A SAT solver conducts searches in which it tries out combinations of true and false for each variable until a solution is found, or all combinations fail implying that the problem is unsatisfiable.

Given the nature of SAT problems, the thought process for solving it involves lots of trial and error, checking different combinations of assigning variables as true or false and backtracking when we meet a contradiction. The SAT solver does this systematically until a solution is found or concluded unsatisfiable.

Let's run the DIMACS through a SAT solver:

The SAT solver returns:

1 -2 -3 4 5 

Answer: This is the assignment that satisfies all clauses in the provided SAT problem. Each variable corresponds to either true or false: 
- '1' corresponds to true for variable 1,
- '-2' corresponds to false for variable 2,
- '-3' corresponds to false for variable 3,
- '4' corresponds to true for variable 4,
- '5' corresponds to true for variable 5.
