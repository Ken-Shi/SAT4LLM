Step 1: Understanding the problem
Each line after the "p cnf" line represents a clause of the problem. Each clause is a disjunction (OR operation) of literals, i.e., a variable or its negation. The '0' at the end of each line is a delimiter and doesn't have a logical meaning. The satisfiability (SAT) problem is to determine a set of literal assignments that will make the entire formula true.

Step 2: Codifying clauses
We can read clauses in a more conventional way, replacing "1" by "x", "2" by "y" and so on:

- -y v v => y implies v
- -z v -u v -y => y and u imply z
- v v u v- y => y implies v or u
- -u v -z v v => z and u imply v
- -w v v v y => v implies w or y
- -u v -w v -y => y and w imply u
- v v -u v -y => y implies v or -u
- v v u v -y => y implies v or u
- -w v -u v -v => v and u imply w
- -z v -w v v => v implies z or w
- -w v -y v v => v implies w or y
- v v -y v z => y implies v or z
- -u v -y v v => y implies u or v
- -u v -y v -z => y implies u or -z
- -z v -v v w => v or z implies w
- v v -z v -y => y implies v or -z
- -w v -z v v => v implies w or z
- -y v -w v -z => z and w imply y
- -w v -y v -z => z and y imply w
- -u v -z v -y  => y and u imply z

Step 3: Providing the solution
Given the above translation and knowing that v and -v can't be true at the same time, an educated guess might be: x=false, y=true, z=true, u=true, w=false.

Step 4: Verification
This assignment can be plugged back into the formula to see if it evaluates to true for every clause. If it does, then we have a solution. 

Answer: 
x = 0, y = 1, z = 1, u = 1, w = 0
