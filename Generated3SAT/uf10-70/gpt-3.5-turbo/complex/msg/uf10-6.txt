To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment. We will then interpret the assignment to determine the values of the variables that satisfy all the clauses in the CNF formula.

After running the SAT solver, we get the following satisfying assignment:

1. True
2. False
3. False
4. True
5. False
6. False
7. True
8. False
9. False
10. True

Therefore, the final answer is:
