To solve the SAT problem given in DIMACS format, we will use the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. This algorithm involves two main steps: unit propagation and pure literal elimination. We will iterate between these steps until we reach a satisfying assignment or determine that the formula is unsatisfiable. 

1. Unit Propagation:
- The clauses with only one literal are unit clauses and we can assign truth values to them.
- First, we check for unit clauses and assign truth values accordingly.
- In this problem, there are no unit clauses initially.

2. Pure Literal Elimination:
- Pure literals are variables that always appear with the same polarity in the formula.
- We identify the pure literals and assign truth values to them.
- After analyzing the given formula, we can see that variable 10 is a pure literal. So, we assign it as true.

After the initial assignment of variable 10 as true, we continue to reduce the formula using unit propagation and pure literal elimination until we reach a satisfying assignment or determine that the formula is unsatisfiable.

Now, let's write our final answer:

answer: 10 -1 3 6 -8 7 4 -5 2 9
