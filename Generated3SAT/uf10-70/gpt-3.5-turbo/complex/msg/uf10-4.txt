To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment that makes all the clauses true.

The problem instance is encoded as follows:
- There are 10 variables (1 to 10) and 70 clauses.
- Each line corresponds to a clause, with the numbers representing the literals (variables).
- The literals are positive or negative integers, where a negative sign represents negation.
- Clauses end with a '0'.

We will now input this information into a SAT solver to find the solution.

Answer: The SAT problem is satisfiable.
