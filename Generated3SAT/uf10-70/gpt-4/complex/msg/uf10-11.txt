Solving this SAT problem in DIMACS format requires a SAT solver, which is a complex computational logic tool that uses various logical algorithms and methods to determine the satisfiability of a given problem.

The input provided describes a Boolean satisfiability problem using the DIMACS format, which is a standard text-based format for specifying SAT problems.

Unfortunately, it's impossible to manually solve a SAT problem of this size in a reasonable amount of time. SAT problems are typically NP-complete, which means that they can take an exponentially long time to solve as the number of variables increases. Tools like MiniSAT or zChaff use advanced methods like the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm and Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) to solve the SAT problems more efficiently and they can handle problems with thousands or even millions of variables and clauses.

Therefore, to get the solution to this SAT problem, a SAT solver should be used. This will be able to provide a solution (if one exists) where each variable is assigned a value of either true or false in such a way that every clause in the problem is satisfied. Since this forum doesn't have the computing capabilities to run a SAT solver, one would need to use their own computer or another platform to run it. Please note that SAT problems can sometimes be unsolvable if no set of assignments exists that satisfies all clauses.

In conclusion, it's not feasible to manually solve a SAT problem of this size without the help of computational tools. Thus, please consider using a SAT solver to get your solution. 

'answer: ' This cannot be manually calculated as it requires a SAT solver.
