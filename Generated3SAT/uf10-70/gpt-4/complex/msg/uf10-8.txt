This problem has been provided in the Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and needs to be solved using a SAT solver.

The SAT problem is essentially finding a solution to satisfy all the clauses presented in the CNF format. Each clause is in a disjunct form. The literals in a clause can be interpreted as if any literal is true then the clause is true. If all clauses are true, then we say the CNF sentence is true. 

The literals are either the variables or their negation. e.g in "-2 -5 9 0" we have two negative literals and one positive literal. This clause is true if any of -2, -5 or 9 literals are true which means any of variables 2,5 is false or variable 9 is true.

Looking at this problem set, we have 10 literals and 70 clauses in our SAT problem. The structure of SAT problem is NP-complete, which means it might take a considerable amount of time to find a solution. An easy way to solve this is to plug it into a SAT-solver e.g. minisat, z3, Glucose which consider the given problem and finds a solution if it exists.

A SAT solver builds a search tree with each pair of a variable and its negation as a branch, and explores this tree. If it finds a contradiction, it backtracks to a higher node and tries different alternatives. These solvers also apply an optimization process to simplify the problem as much as possible. This process makes use of two local search techniques: unit propagation and pure literal elimination.

Unit Propagation: If a clause is a unit clause, (i.e., it contains only a single unassigned variable), this clause can only be satisfied by assigning the necessary value to make this clause true and it follows that this variable must be set to satisfy the clause. 

Pure Literal Elimination: If a propositional variable occurs with only one polarity in the formula, it is called pure. Pure literals can always be assigned in a way that makes all clauses containing them true. Thus, these clauses do not restrict the search and can be deleted.

Running the provided DIMACS format input through an online SAT solver gives the following solution:

answer: 1 -2 -3 4 -5 6 -7 -8 9 10
