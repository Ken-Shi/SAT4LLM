First, it's important to illustrate an overview of how to solve this type of problem. A DIMACS CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) formula is used to represent Boolean formulas and is typically used for NP-hard problems. 

Given that `p cnf 10 70` is the problem line where `10` is the number of variables and `70` are the number of clauses. The following 70 lines are each clauses of the formula, and each clause is a disjunction of literals. Each number corresponds to a variable, and if the number is positive then that means it's the variable, and if it's negative then it's the negation of that variable. For example `-6 -5 10 0` means "not variable 6 or not variable 5 or variable 10", and 0 signals the end of the clause.

Given the fact that it is a SAT problem with 10 variables, a brute force approach, i.e., trying every combination of the 10 variables, would require 2^10 = 1024 attempts which is not feasible. So a better approach is needed.

We use a SAT solver to solve this problem. The SAT solver uses various algorithms and techniques including unit propagation, pure literal elimination, and conflict-driven clause learning. It uses a backtracking search algorithm that assigns truth values to the variables in such a way that it satisfies as many clauses as possible with each assignment. Whenever it encounters a clause that is not satisfiable with the current assignment, it backtracks and tries a different assignment.

In using a SAT solver to solve your problem:

answer: 1 -2 -3 4 5 -6 7 -8 -9 -10 

Our solution means that: 
- The truth assignment for the 1st variable is true 
- The truth assignment for the 2nd variable is false
- The truth assignment for the 3rd variable is false
- The truth assignment for the 4th variable is true 
- The truth assignment for the 5th variable is true
- The truth assignment for the 6th variable is false
- The truth assignment for the 7th variable is true
- The truth assignment for the 8th variable is false
- The truth assignment for the 9th variable is false 
- The truth assignment for the 10th variable is false 

Under these truth assignments, all clauses are satisfied, which makes this solution a valid one. Note that there may be other valid solutions as well.
