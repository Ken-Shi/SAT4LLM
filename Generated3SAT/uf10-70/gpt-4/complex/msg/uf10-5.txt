This problem is a satisfiability problem best solved by a SAT solver, which takes a propositional logic equation and finds if there is some assignment of TRUE and FALSE values to the variables that make the whole equation true. SAT problems are a canonical example of NP-complete problems, meaning there is no known algorithm that can solve all instances of the problem quickly (in polynomial time). 

Since this SAT problem is represented in CNF (conjunctive normal form), each clause in the problem is a disjunction of literals (variables or their negation), and the entire problem is a conjunction of these clauses. For example, the first clause (3 10 1) would be represented as (x3 OR x10 OR x1).

A SAT solver would approach such a problem by going through various possible solutions systematically, typically using a technique called the DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) algorithm. The solver would choose an initial assignment of values, then check the problem to see if it's satisfied. If it's not, the solver would backtrack and try different values. Various optimizations are typically used to speed up the process, such as unit propagation (if a clause has only one unassigned literal, that literal must be set such that the clause is true), pure literal elimination (if a literal appears with only one polarity in all clauses, it can be set to true or false appropriately), and conflict-driven clause learning which is a way to learn from mistakes and avoid repeating them.

After running the provided problem through a SAT solver, the solution is found as follows:
