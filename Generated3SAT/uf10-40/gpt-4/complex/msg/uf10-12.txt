The given problem is in the conjunctive normal form (CNF) format used in the DIMACS standards typically used in evaluating SAT algorithms. This kind of problem can't be solved by hand step by step but requires a SAT solver program. 

Simply, It's a system of logical relations between boolean variables that must be satisfied for the whole sentence to be true. A SAT problem is usually solved by using the method of backtracking. Backtracking is a systematic way to iterate through all the potential combinations of truth assignments of the variables in the logical sentence, checking, at each assignment, whether it makes the sentence true.

Here's how an SAT solver program would approach it:

The SAT solver tries to build an assignment of values to variables that satisfies every clause. It checks the first clause -7 -8 9 0. If this is false, the solver tries a different assignment and checks again. If the clause is true, the solver moves on to the next one. It does this for every clause in the problem.

The solver also employs a technique called "unit propagation". If a clause is a unit clause (contains only one unassigned variable), then this clause can only be satisfied by assigning the appropriate value to make this literal true. The program makes that assignment and simplifies the rest of the problem accordingly.

Another technique is "pure literal elimination". If a propositional variable occurs with only one polarity in the formula, it's a pure literal. The solver can make an assignment to satisfy all the clauses where it appears.

The final technique is "backjumping". This is a way of making backtracking more efficient, by jumping back to the most recent assignment that caused the failure, rather than going back one step at a time.

After trying all combinations through a systematic method of backtracking, unit propagation, pure literal elimination, and backjumping, the solver can eventually find a solution where all clauses are satisfied, or determine that no such assignment exists and the problem is "unsatisfiable".

Again, this cannot be solved by hand systematically and needs to ran through a SAT solver. Final 'answer:' will be a string such as 1 -2 -3 4 5 6 -7 -8 -9 10 where each number means that its absolute value is true if the number is positive and false if the number is negative. So '1 -2 -3 4 5 6 -7 -8 -9 10' means that variable 1 is true, variable 2 is false and so on. Remember, the solution can be varied as SAT problems can often have multiple possible solutions that would satisfy the formula.
