To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to apply the DPLL algorithm. Let's break down the steps:

1. Initialize an empty interpretation.
2. Check each clause and identify if there are singletons.
3. Unit propagate singletons by setting their corresponding variables in the interpretation.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until no more singletons can be found.
5. If a contradiction arises (e.g., both a variable and its negation are true), backtrack to the last decision point and try an alternative assignment.
6. If all variables are assigned without contradiction, check if the interpretation satisfies all clauses. If so, the problem is satisfiable.
7. If there are unassigned variables and no possible values left to try due to conflict, backtrack again to the last decision point and try an alternative assignment.
8. Continue this process until all possible assignments are exhausted.

Let's start the process:

Clause 1: {-1, 4, -10}
No singleton here. Move on.

Clause 2: {6, 2, -3}
No singleton here. Move on.

Clause 3: {-6, 3, -5}
Singleton: -5
Assigning -5 to True.

Clause 6: {-9, -8, -3}
Singleton: -8
Assigning -8 to True.

Clause 8: {-7, 1, 4}
No singleton here. Move on.

Clause 9: {-10, -1, 9}
Singleton: -10
Assigning -10 to True.

Clause 12: {4, -8, 10}
No singleton here. Move on.

Clause 13: {-2, -7, -5}
Singleton: -2
Assigning -2 to True.

Clause 19: {-1, 2, -5}
No singleton here. Move on.

Clause 20: {9, 10, 2}
No singleton here. Move on.

Clause 27: {5, -7, 4}
Singleton: 5
Assigning 5 to True.

Clause 28: {3, -7, -8}
No singleton here. Move on.

At this point, we have assigned all singletons, and we are left with the following unassigned variables: 1, 6, 7, and 9. Let's try assigning values to these variables:

Assigning 1 to True:
Clause 5: {-7, -1, 4}
This assignment leads to a contradiction since -7 is already assigned to False. Backtrack.

Assigning 1 to False (1 is already False):
Assigning 6 to True:
Clause 2: {6, 2, -3}
This assignment leads to a contradiction since 3 is already assigned to False. Backtrack.

Assigning 6 to False (6 is already False):
Assigning 7 to True:
Clause 36: {-7, 5, -9}
This assignment leads to a contradiction since 5 is already assigned to True. Backtrack.

Assigning 7 to False (7 is already False):
Assigning 9 to True:
Clause 22: {2, 10, -9}
This assignment leads to a contradiction since 2 is already assigned to True. Backtrack.

Assigning 9 to False (9 is already False):
No more possible assignments to try. Therefore, the problem is unsatisfiable.

answer: UNSATISFIABLE
