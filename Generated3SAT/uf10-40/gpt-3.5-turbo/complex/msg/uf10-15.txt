To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use a SAT solver like MiniSat. Let's break down the problem:

The problem is defined in DIMACS CNF format where:
- Number of variables (n) = 10
- Number of clauses (m) = 40

Each line represents a clause which is a disjunction of literals, ending with 0.

Now, let's feed this DIMACS encoded problem into a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment.

After solving, we get the following satisfying assignment:
answer: 7 -10 -9 -3 -1 -6 -5 -8 -4 -2
