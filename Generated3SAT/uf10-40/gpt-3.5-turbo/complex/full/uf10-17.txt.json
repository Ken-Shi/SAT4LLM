Each line corresponds to a clause, with a \"0\" at the end indicating the end of the clause. The numbers represent the literals, where positive numbers indicate the variable is included and negative numbers indicate the negation of the variable is included in the clause.\n\nWe will use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment for this problem.\n\nanswer: The SAT problem is satisfiable. A satisfying assignment is:\n1: True\n2: True\n3: False\n4: False\n5: False\n6: True\n7: True\n8: True\n9: False\n10: False"
