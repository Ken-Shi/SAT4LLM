To solve this SAT problem, we will apply the DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) algorithm. We will first convert the problem from DIMACS format to a more readable representation:

1. (-3 v -2 v -1)
2. (2 v -1 v -3)
3. (1 v 2 v 3)
4. (-1 v -3 v 2)
5. (-1 v 2 v -3)
6. (2 v -3 v -1)
7. (-3 v -1 v 2)
8. (2 v 3 v -1)
9. (-3 v -2 v -1)

Let's go through the clauses one by one and combine them based on the variables present:

1. (-3 v -2 v -1) - If 3, 2, or 1 is true, this clause is satisfied.
2. (2 v -1 v -3) - If 2 is true, this clause is satisfied.
3. (1 v 2 v 3) - If 1, 2, or 3 is true, this clause is satisfied.
4. (-1 v -3 v 2) - If -1, -3, or 2 is true, this clause is satisfied.
5. (-1 v 2 v -3) - If -1, 2, or -3 is true, this clause is satisfied.
6. (2 v -3 v -1) - If 2, -3, or -1 is true, this clause is satisfied.
7. (-3 v -1 v 2) - If -3, -1, or 2 is true, this clause is satisfied.
8. (2 v 3 v -1) - If 2, 3, or -1 is true, this clause is satisfied.
9. (-3 v -2 v -1) - If 3, 2, or 1 is true, this clause is satisfied.

Now, we will start assigning truth values to the variables and propagate their effects through the clauses:

Let's start with assuming each variable to be true one by one:
1. If variable 1 is true, clauses 3, 4, 5, and 8 are satisfied. However, clause 2 is not satisfied, so variable 1 cannot be true.
2. If variable 2 is true, clauses 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are satisfied. So, variable 2 can be true.
3. If variable 3 is true, clauses 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are satisfied. So, variable 3 can be true.

Therefore, the solution to the SAT problem is variable 2 being TRUE.

answer: 2
