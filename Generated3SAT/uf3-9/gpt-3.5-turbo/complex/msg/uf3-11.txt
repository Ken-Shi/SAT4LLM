To solve this SAT problem, we need to find a solution that satisfies all clauses. 

Looking at the clauses:
1. (3, -2, 1)
2. (1, 3, -2)
3. (1, -2, -3)
4. (-2, 3, 1)
5. (-2, -3, 1)
6. (1, 2, 3)
7. (-2, 3, 1)
8. (-2, 1, 3)
9. (-2, 1, 3)

We can simplify some of the clauses:
- 1, 2, 8, 9 are equivalent to (1, 2, 3)
- 4 and 7 are equivalent to (-2, 3, 1)

Thus, we can reduce the problem to the following clauses:
1. (3, -2, 1)
2. (1, -2, -3)
3. (-2, 3, 1)
4. (-2, -3, 1)
5. (1, 2, 3)

Since clause 1 and 3 have contradictory literals (-2, 3), we cannot satisfy all clauses simultaneously. Therefore, the problem is unsatisfiable.

answer: UNSATISFIABLE
