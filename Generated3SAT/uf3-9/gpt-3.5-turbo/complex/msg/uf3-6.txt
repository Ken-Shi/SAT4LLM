First, let's analyze the DIMACS format:
p cnf 3 9 indicates that there are 3 variables and 9 clauses.
The clauses are as follows:
-3 1 2 0
3 2 1 0
-2 3 1 0
3 1 2 0
-2 -1 3 0
-1 3 2 0
3 1 2 0
-2 1 3 0
1 3 -2 0

Now, let's start solving the problem using a brute force approach:
We will assign 1 to variable 1, -1 to variable 2, and -1 to variable 3. We will substitute these values in the given clauses.
So, for clause -3 1 2 0, it becomes -(-1) 1 -1 0, which is true.
For clause 3 2 1 0, it becomes 1 -1 1 0, which is true.
For clause -2 3 1 0, it becomes -1 -1 1 0, which is true.
For clause 3 1 2 0, it becomes 1 1 -1 0, which is true.
For clause -2 -1 3 0, it becomes -1 -1 -1 0, which is true.
For clause -1 3 2 0, it becomes -1 1 -1 0, which is true.
For clause 3 1 2 0, it becomes 1 1 -1 0, which is true.
For clause -2 1 3 0, it becomes -1 1 1 0, which is true.
For clause 1 3 -2 0, it becomes 1 1 -1 0, which is true.

All the clauses are true with the given assignments, so the solution is satisfiable.

answer: The solution is satisfiable.
