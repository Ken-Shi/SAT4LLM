To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use the following line of thoughts:

1. Translate the DIMACS format into a more readable format:
- (?1 ? ?2 ? 3)
- (3 ? ?1 ? ?2)
- (3 ? ?1 ? ?2)
- (?2 ? ?1 ? 3)
- (2 ? ?3 ? ?1)
- (2 ? 3 ? 1)
- (1 ? ?2 ? 3)
- (?2 ? ?1 ? 3)
- (?1 ? ?2 ? 3)

2. The problem is to find values for variables 1, 2, and 3 that satisfy all clauses in the CNF formula.

3. Evaluating each clause with the values of variables:
- For clause 1: (?1 ? ?2 ? 3), only assigning 1 = false, 2 = false, 3 = true satisfies this clause.
- For clause 2: (3 ? ?1 ? ?2), assigning 1 = false, 2 = false, 3 = true also satisfies this clause.
- For clause 3: (3 ? ?1 ? ?2), same as clause 2.
- For clause 4: (?2 ? ?1 ? 3), assigning 1 = false, 2 = false, 3 = true again satisfies this clause.
- For clause 5: (2 ? ?3 ? ?1), any assignment of values for variables does not satisfy this clause.
- For clause 6: (2 ? 3 ? 1), assigning 1 = true, 2 = false, 3 = true satisfies this clause.
- For clause 7: (1 ? ?2 ? 3), assigning 1 = true, 2 = false, 3 = true satisfies this clause.
- For clause 8: (?2 ? ?1 ? 3), same as clause 4.
- For clause 9: (?1 ? ?2 ? 3), same as clause 1.

4. Based on the evaluation, an assignment that satisfies all clauses is 1 = true, 2 = false, and 3 = true.

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: 1=true, 2=false, 3=true
