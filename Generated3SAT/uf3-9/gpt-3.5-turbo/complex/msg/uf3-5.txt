To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to first transform the problem into a more readable form. 

The DIMACS format provided represents a SAT problem with 3 variables and 9 clauses. The clauses are as follows:
1. -3 2 1 
2. -3 -1 2
3. 1 -2 3
4. 2 1 -3
5. -3 1 2
6. 1 2 3
7. -3 1 2
8. -3 2 1
9. 1 -3 2

Now, we need to try to find values for variables 1, 2, and 3 that satisfy all of the clauses. Let's start analyzing each clause one by one:
1. -3 2 1: This clause is satisfied if either variables 1 or 2 are true.
2. -3 -1 2: This clause is satisfied if variable 2 is true.
3. 1 -2 3: This clause is satisfied if variable 1 is true.
4. 2 1 -3: This clause is satisfied if either variables 1 or 2 are true.
5. -3 1 2: This clause is satisfied if either variables 1 or 2 are true.
6. 1 2 3: This clause is satisfied if all variables are true.
7. -3 1 2: This clause is satisfied if either variables 1 or 2 are true.
8. -3 2 1: This clause is satisfied if either variables 1 or 2 are true.
9. 1 -3 2: This clause is satisfied if either variables 1 or 2 are true.

From the analysis above, we see that all of the clauses can be satisfied if variables 1 and 2 are true. 

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: 1 1 0
