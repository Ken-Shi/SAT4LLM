To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we first need to convert the given clauses into a more understandable format:

The CNF formula with 3 variables and 9 clauses is:
1. ?A ? ?C ? B
2. C ? B ? A
3. B ? C ? ?A
4. ?A ? B ? C
5. C ? B ? ?A
6. ?A ? ?B ? C
7. B ? C ? ?A
8. C ? B ? ?A
9. ?A ? ?B ? C

Now, we can try to find a satisfying assignment or show that it is unsatisfiable. Let's go through the clauses one by one:

From clause 1, we can set A = 0, C = 0, B = 1.
From clause 2, we can confirm that this assignment satisfies the clause.
From clause 3, we can confirm that this assignment satisfies the clause.
From clause 4, we can confirm that this assignment satisfies the clause.
From clause 5, we can confirm that this assignment satisfies the clause.
From clause 6, we can confirm that this assignment satisfies the clause.
From clause 7, we can confirm that this assignment satisfies the clause.
From clause 8, we can confirm that this assignment satisfies the clause.
From clause 9, we can confirm that this assignment satisfies the clause.

Therefore, the satisfying assignment for this SAT problem is A = 0, B = 1, C = 0.

answer: A = 0, B = 1, C = 0
