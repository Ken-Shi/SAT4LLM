First, we need to convert the DIMACS format into a more readable format of logical expressions:

1. (?C v A v B)
2. (?A v C v B)
3. (?B v A v ?C)
4. (?B v ?C v ?A)
5. (?C v ?B v ?A)
6. (?C v ?A v ?B)
7. (?C v ?A v ?B)
8. (?A v ?C v B)
9. (?C v ?A v ?B)

To solve this problem, we can use the resolution method. Starting from the initial clauses and applying resolution to derive new clauses, we can check if the empty clause can be derived, which would indicate unsatisfiability.

Starting with the initial clauses:

1. (?C v A v B)
2. (?A v C v B)
3. (?B v A v ?C)
4. (?B v ?C v ?A)
5. (?C v ?B v ?A)
6. (?C v ?A v ?B)
7. (?C v ?A v ?B)
8. (?A v ?C v B)
9. (?C v ?A v ?B)

Applying resolution on clauses 1 and 2 with A:

10. (?C v B v B)

Applying resolution on clauses 4 and 1 with ?A:

11. (?B v ?C v B)
12. (?C v ?B v B)

Applying resolution on clauses 11 and 3 with B:

13. (?C v ?C v ?C)

Since we have derived the empty clause ?C v ?C v ?C, which is always false, the original set of clauses is unsatisfiable.

Therefore, the answer to this SAT problem is: UNSATISFIABLE

answer: UNSATISFIABLE
