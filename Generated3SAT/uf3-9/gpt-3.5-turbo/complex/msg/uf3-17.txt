To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to convert the clauses into a more readable format. Each line represents a clause, with variables separated by spaces and ending with a 0. The first line specifies that there are 3 variables and 9 clauses.

The clauses are as follows:
1. (-1 v -3 v -2)
2. (3 v 1 v -2)
3. (1 v 3 v 2)
4. (3 v -1 v -2)
5. (-2 v 1 v 3)
6. (1 v -2 v 3)
7. (3 v -1 v -2)
8. (-2 v 3 v -1)
9. (1 v -3 v -2)

Now, we will run a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment for these clauses.

answer: The SAT problem is unsatisfiable.
