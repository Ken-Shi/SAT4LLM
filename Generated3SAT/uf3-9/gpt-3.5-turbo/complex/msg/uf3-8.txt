To solve this SAT problem, we will first convert the DIMACS format into readable clauses:

1. (3, 1, 2)
2. (1, 2, -3)
3. (-2, 1, -3)
4. (-3, 1, 2)
5. (1, 2, -3)
6. (1, 2, -3)
7. (1, 2, -3)
8. (-1, 2, -3)
9. (-3, 2, 1)

Now, we can simplify the problem by removing duplicate clauses:

1. (3, 1, 2)
2. (1, 2, -3)
3. (-2, 1, -3)
4. (-3, 1, 2)
5. (-1, 2, -3)

From these reduced clauses, we can see that clause 1 is true since it contains all positive literals. Therefore, there exist a solution for the given SAT problem.

answer: The given SAT problem is satisfiable.
