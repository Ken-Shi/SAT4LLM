To solve this SAT problem, we will use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment for the given clauses in DIMACS format. The DIMACS format provided indicates that there are three variables and nine clauses.

The clauses can be represented as follows:
(?1 ? ?3 ? 2)
(?2 ? ?1 ? 3)
(2 ? 3 ? ?1)
(?3 ? ?2 ? ?1)
(3 ? 2 ? 1)
(2 ? 3 ? ?1)
(3 ? ?2 ? ?1)
(3 ? ?1 ? 2)
(?1 ? 2 ? 3)

Now we will use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment for these clauses.

Answer: This problem is unsatisfiable.
