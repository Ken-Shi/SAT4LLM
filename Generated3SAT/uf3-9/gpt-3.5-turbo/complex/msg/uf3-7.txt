To solve this problem, we can start by converting the DIMACS format into a logical expression:

(1 OR NOT 3 OR 2) AND (NOT 3 OR 1 OR 2) AND (NOT 3 OR 2 OR 1) AND (2 OR 1 OR 3) AND (2 OR NOT 1 OR NOT 3) AND (NOT 3 OR 2 OR 1) AND (NOT 1 OR 2 OR 3) AND (3 OR 1 OR 2) AND (NOT 3 OR 2 OR 1)

Next, we can simplify the logical expression:
- From the 2nd and 5th clauses, we can infer that 2 must be true since it appears with opposite signs.
- Using the 4th clause, we can infer that 2 and 3 must both be true.
- From the 3rd and 9th clauses, we can infer that 1 must be true since it appears with opposite signs.
- Finally, from the 1st clause, we can infer that 1 and 2 cannot both be true since they appear with opposite signs.

After running through these deductions, we can see that there is a contradiction as 2 must be true based on multiple clauses. Thus, the problem is unsatisfiable.

Therefore, the final answer is: 
answer: UNSATISFIABLE
