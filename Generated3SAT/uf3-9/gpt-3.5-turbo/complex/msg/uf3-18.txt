To solve this SAT problem, we need to analyze the given DIMACS format. The first line indicates that there are 3 variables and 9 clauses in the SAT problem.

Next, we have the following 9 clauses:
1. -3 -2 1
2. 1 2 -3
3. 2 1 -3
4. 1 2 -3
5. -3 -1 2
6. 2 3 1
7. 1 3 2
8. 1 -3 2
9. 1 2 -3

We can now try to find a satisfying assignment for these clauses.
