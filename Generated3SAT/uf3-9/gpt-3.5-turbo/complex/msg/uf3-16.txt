To solve this SAT problem in DIMACS format, we need to convert the clauses into logical equations and then find a satisfying assignment.

The DIMACS format in this problem has 3 variables and 9 clauses.
The clauses are as follows:
1. (-2 OR -1 OR 3)
2. (-1 OR -2 OR 3)
3. (2 OR 3 OR -1)
4. (2 OR -3 OR -1)
5. (-2 OR -3 OR -1)
6. (-1 OR 3 OR -2)
7. (-1 OR 3 OR -2)
8. (-1 OR -2 OR 3)
9. (-1 OR -2 OR 3)

We will now try to find a satisfying assignment by simplifying the clauses:
1. (-2 OR -1 OR 3) = T
2. (-1 OR -2 OR 3) = T
3. (2 OR 3 OR -1) = T
4. (2 OR -3 OR -1) = T
5. (-2 OR -3 OR -1) = T
6. (-1 OR 3 OR -2) = T
7. (-1 OR 3 OR -2) = T
8. (-1 OR -2 OR 3) = T
9. (-1 OR -2 OR 3) = T

Since all the clauses simplify to True, we have found a satisfying assignment.

Therefore, the answer is:
answer: 2 -1 3
