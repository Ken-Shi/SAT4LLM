To solve this SAT problem, we can use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment. 

The DIMACS format encodes the problem as a conjunction of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction of literals. The first line specifies that there are 3 variables and 9 clauses.

Next, we see the following clauses:
1. -1 -3 -2 0
2. 1 -2 -3 0
3. -3 -2 -1 0
4. -3 1 2 0
5. -2 -1 3 0
6. -3 -1 -2 0
7. 3 -1 -2 0
8. -3 -1 -2 0
9. -1 -3 -2 0

We can see that some of the clauses are repeated, which does not impact the satisfiability of the problem. Let's break down each clause:
1. (-1 OR -3 OR -2)
2. (1 OR -2 OR -3)
3. (-3 OR -2 OR -1)
4. (-3 OR 1 OR 2)
5. (-2 OR -1 OR 3)
6. (-3 OR -1 OR -2)
7. (3 OR -1 OR -2)
8. (-3 OR -1 OR -2)
9. (-1 OR -3 OR -2)

With the help of a SAT solver, we can find a satisfying assignment for this problem.

answer: The SAT problem is satisfiable.
