To solve this SAT problem, let's first decode the DIMACS format:
- There are 3 variables
- There are 9 clauses

Now, let's analyze the clauses:
1. 3 2 1 : requires all three variables to be true (1 1 1)
2. 2 -3 1 : requires either variables 2 and 1 to be true or variable 3 to be false (1 0 1 or 1 1 0)
3. 2 3 1 : requires either variables 2 and 1 to be true or variables 3 and 2 to be true (1 1 1 or 1 1 1)
4. 3 1 2 : requires all three variables to be true (1 1 1)
5. 3 1 2 : requires all three variables to be true (1 1 1)
6. 2 3 1 : requires either variables 2 and 1 to be true or variables 3 and 1 to be true (1 1 1 or 1 1 1)
7. 3 1 2 : requires all three variables to be true (1 1 1)
8. 2 1 3 : requires either variables 1 and 3 to be true or variables 2 and 1 to be true (1 1 1 or 1 1 1)
9. 3 2 1 : requires all three variables to be true (1 1 1)

From the analysis above, we can see that variables 1, 2, and 3 should all be true for all clauses to be satisfied.

Therefore, the solution is:
answer: 1 1 1
