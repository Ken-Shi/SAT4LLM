To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to analyze the clauses given and try to find a satisfying assignment.

The DIMACS format provided indicates that there are 3 variables and 9 clauses:

1. 3 2 -1 0
2. 3 2 -1 0
3. 2 -1 3 0
4. -1 2 3 0
5. 3 2 1 0
6. -1 2 3 0
7. 3 2 -1 0
8. -1 3 2 0
9. 3 2 -1 0

Each clause is separated by a '0' and the negation of the variables (indicated by a '-' sign) are also included.

Now let's analyze the clauses:

1. Clauses 1, 2, 7, and 9 all contain the same set of variables {3, 2, -1}. This means that these clauses can only be satisfied if variable 3 is assigned as true (since -1 indicates the negation of the variable).
2. Clauses 3, 4, 6, and 8 contain the variables {2, -1, 3}. Similarly, these clauses can only be satisfied if variable 2 is assigned as true.
3. Clause 5 contains variables {3, 2, 1}. This clause can be satisfied if all variables are assigned as true.

Based on the analysis above, it is clear that the only satisfying assignment that makes all the clauses true is when variable 3, 2, and 1 are all assigned as true.

Therefore, the final answer in DIMACS format is:
answer: 1 2 3
