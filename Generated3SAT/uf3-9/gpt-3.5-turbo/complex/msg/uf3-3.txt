To solve the SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to analyze each clause and find a satisfying assignment that makes all clauses true.

The problem is represented by the following clauses:
1. -1 3 2 0
2. 3 2 -1 0
3. -1 -2 3 0
4. -2 -3 -1 0
5. -2 3 -1 0
6. 3 -2 1 0
7. -1 3 -2 0
8. -1 -2 3 0
9. 2 -3 -1 0

Let's analyze each clause:
1. Clause 1 can be satisfied by assigning false to variable 1, true to variable 3, and true to variable 2.
2. Clause 2 can be satisfied by assigning true to variables 3, 2, and false to variable 1.
3. Clause 3 can be satisfied by assigning false to variable 1, false to variable 2, and true to variable 3.
4. Clause 4 can be satisfied by assigning false to variables 2, 3, and 1.
5. Clause 5 can be satisfied by assigning false to variable 2, true to variable 3, and false to variable 1.
6. Clause 6 can be satisfied by assigning true to variable 3, false to variable 2, and true to variable 1.
7. Clause 7 can be satisfied by assigning false to variable 1, true to variable 3, and false to variable 2.
8. Clause 8 can be satisfied by assigning false to variable 1, false to variable 2, and true to variable 3.
9. Clause 9 can be satisfied by assigning true to variable 2, false to variable 3, and false to variable 1.

Therefore, a satisfying assignment for all clauses is:
1. Variable 1 is false, variable 2 is true, and variable 3 is true.

Answer: 1 = False, 2 = True, 3 = True.
