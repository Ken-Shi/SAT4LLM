We will substitute these values in the given clauses.\nSo, for clause -3 1 2 0, it becomes -(-1) 1 -1 0, which is true.\nFor clause 3 2 1 0, it becomes 1 -1 1 0, which is true.\nFor clause -2 3 1 0, it becomes -1 -1 1 0, which is true.\nFor clause 3 1 2 0, it becomes 1 1 -1 0, which is true.\nFor clause -2 -1 3 0, it becomes -1 -1 -1 0, which is true.\nFor clause -1 3 2 0, it becomes -1 1 -1 0, which is true.\nFor clause 3 1 2 0, it becomes 1 1 -1 0, which is true.\nFor clause -2 1 3 0, it becomes -1 1 1 0, which is true.\nFor clause 1 3 -2 0, it becomes 1 1 -1 0, which is true.\n\nAll the clauses are true with the given assignments, so the solution is satisfiable.\n\nanswer: The solution is satisfiable."
