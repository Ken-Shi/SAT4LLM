Clause 1 can be satisfied by assigning false to variable 1, true to variable 3, and true to variable 2.\n2. Clause 2 can be satisfied by assigning true to variables 3, 2, and false to variable 1.\n3. Clause 3 can be satisfied by assigning false to variable 1, false to variable 2, and true to variable 3.\n4. Clause 4 can be satisfied by assigning false to variables 2, 3, and 1.\n5. Clause 5 can be satisfied by assigning false to variable 2, true to variable 3, and false to variable 1.\n6. Clause 6 can be satisfied by assigning true to variable 3, false to variable 2, and true to variable 1.\n7. Clause 7 can be satisfied by assigning false to variable 1, true to variable 3, and false to variable 2.\n8. Clause 8 can be satisfied by assigning false to variable 1, false to variable 2, and true to variable 3.\n9. Clause 9 can be satisfied by assigning true to variable 2, false to variable 3, and false to variable 1.\n\nTherefore, a satisfying assignment for all clauses is:\n1. Variable 1 is false, variable 2 is true, and variable 3 is true.\n\nAnswer: 1 = False, 2 = True, 3 = True."
