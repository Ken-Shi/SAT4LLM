The clauses are as follows:\n1. -3 2 1 \n2. -3 -1 2\n3. 1 -2 3\n4. 2 1 -3\n5. -3 1 2\n6. 1 2 3\n7. -3 1 2\n8. -3 2 1\n9. 1 -3 2\n\nNow, we need to try to find values for variables 1, 2, and 3 that satisfy all of the clauses. Let's start analyzing each clause one by one:\n1. -3 2 1: This clause is satisfied if either variables 1 or 2 are true.\n2. -3 -1 2: This clause is satisfied if variable 2 is true.\n3. 1 -2 3: This clause is satisfied if variable 1 is true.\n4. 2 1 -3: This clause is satisfied if either variables 1 or 2 are true.\n5. -3 1 2: This clause is satisfied if either variables 1 or 2 are true.\n6. 1 2 3: This clause is satisfied if all variables are true.\n7. -3 1 2: This clause is satisfied if either variables 1 or 2 are true.\n8. -3 2 1: This clause is satisfied if either variables 1 or 2 are true.\n9. 1 -3 2: This clause is satisfied if either variables 1 or 2 are true.\n\nFrom the analysis above, we see that all of the clauses can be satisfied if variables 1 and 2 are true. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nanswer: 1 1 0"
