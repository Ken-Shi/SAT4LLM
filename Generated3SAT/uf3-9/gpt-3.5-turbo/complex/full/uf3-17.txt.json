Each line represents a clause, with variables separated by spaces and ending with a 0. The first line specifies that there are 3 variables and 9 clauses.\n\nThe clauses are as follows:\n1. (-1 v -3 v -2)\n2. (3 v 1 v -2)\n3. (1 v 3 v 2)\n4. (3 v -1 v -2)\n5. (-2 v 1 v 3)\n6. (1 v -2 v 3)\n7. (3 v -1 v -2)\n8. (-2 v 3 v -1)\n9. (1 v -3 v -2)\n\nNow, we will run a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment for these clauses.\n\nanswer: The SAT problem is unsatisfiable."
