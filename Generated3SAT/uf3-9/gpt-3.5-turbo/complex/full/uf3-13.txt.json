C \u2228 B \u2228 A\n3. B \u2228 C \u2228 \u00acA\n4. \u00acA \u2228 B \u2228 C\n5. C \u2228 B \u2228 \u00acA\n6. \u00acA \u2228 \u00acB \u2228 C\n7. B \u2228 C \u2228 \u00acA\n8. C \u2228 B \u2228 \u00acA\n9. \u00acA \u2228 \u00acB \u2228 C\n\nNow, we can try to find a satisfying assignment or show that it is unsatisfiable. Let's go through the clauses one by one:\n\nFrom clause 1, we can set A = 0, C = 0, B = 1.\nFrom clause 2, we can confirm that this assignment satisfies the clause.\nFrom clause 3, we can confirm that this assignment satisfies the clause.\nFrom clause 4, we can confirm that this assignment satisfies the clause.\nFrom clause 5, we can confirm that this assignment satisfies the clause.\nFrom clause 6, we can confirm that this assignment satisfies the clause.\nFrom clause 7, we can confirm that this assignment satisfies the clause.\nFrom clause 8, we can confirm that this assignment satisfies the clause.\nFrom clause 9, we can confirm that this assignment satisfies the clause.\n\nTherefore, the satisfying assignment for this SAT problem is A = 0, B = 1, C = 0.\n\nanswer: A = 0, B = 1, C = 0"
