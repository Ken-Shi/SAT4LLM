                "content": "When solving SAT problems, we check to see if there exists an assignment to the variables that makes the formula true. The formula is a conjunction of clauses, where a clause is a disjunction of literals (variables or their negation). \n\nThe DIMACS format represents these clauses, or 'lines', as follows:\n\n- A '0' delimits the end of a specific clause.\n- A positive integer represents a positive variable.\n- A negative integer represents a negated variable.\n\nStarting off with the provided formula, let's begin to iterate through the clauses:\n\n1. -1 -3 -2 0: This indicates that clause 1 is satisfied by NOT having all three propositions (1,2,3) to be true. This means at least one has to be false. For the time being, let's assume that 1 is false (-1).\n\n2. Continuing this method, we find that we have conflicting information in later clauses. For example, clause 3 (1 3 2 0) requires at least one of 1, 2, or 3 to be true. However -1 is already set from clause 1, we'll keep 2 and 3 as true for clause 3.\n\n3. In clause 4 (3 -1 -2 0), it contradicts our assumption in clause 3 that 2 is true. So, we are forced to make 3 as True.\n\n4. From here, in clause 5 (-2 1 3 0), we have 3 as true. So, this clause is already satisfied. This allows us to keep our assumption that 2 is false.\n\n5. Then in clause 6 (1 -2 3 0), we have -2 from our previous assumptions and 3 as true. So, this clause is satisfied.\n\n6. Similarly, clauses 7 (3 -1 -2 0), clause 8 (-2 3 -1 0), and clause 9 (1 -3 -2 0) are all satisfied because either 3 is true or -2 is true or both.\n\nAfter this checking process, it appears that our assumptions have led us to a consistent solution to the SAT problem. \n\nanswer: \n\n1 = false,\n2 = false\n3 = true"
