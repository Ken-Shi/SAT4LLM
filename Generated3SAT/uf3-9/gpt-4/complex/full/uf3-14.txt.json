                "content": "The provided problem is in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) where each line represents a clause in the problem and the numbers are literals (an atom or its negation). The literal of 0 at the end of every line denotes the end of the clause.\n\nThe CNF problem consists of 3 variables (1, 2 and 3) and 9 clauses. In order to find a solution, we will assign True or False to each variable to satisfy the clauses.\n\nThe goal is to find an assignment that makes all of the clauses true, which effectively will satisfy the whole problem.\n\nLet's analyze clause by clause:\n\n1. -3 -1 -2 0: Here, one of -3 or -1 or -2 must be true, which means either 3, 1, or 2 should be false.\n2. -3 -1 2 0: Here, either -3 or -1 must be true OR 2 must be true.\n3. -1 -3 -2 0: Here, either -1 or -3 must be true OR -2 must be true.\n4. 2 -3 -1 0: Either 2 must be true OR -3 or -1 must be true.\n5. -2 3 -1 0: Either -2 or 3 must be true OR -1 must be true.\n6. -2 -3 -1 0: Either -2 or -3 must be true OR -1 must be true.\n7. -1 -3 2 0: Either -1 or -3 must be true OR 2 must be true.\n8. 2 -3 1 0: Either 2 must be true OR -3 must be true OR 1 must be true.\n9. 2 -3 -1 0: Either 2 must be true OR -3 or -1 must be true.\n\nBased on the clauses above an assignment that will satisfy the clauses can be the following:\n\nLet the assignment be as follows:\n1 = False, 2 = True, 3 = False.\n\nBy substituting these values in clauses, we can easily see that all clauses are satisfied and therefore it is a valid solution.\n\nAnswer: 1 = False, 2 = True, 3 = False"
