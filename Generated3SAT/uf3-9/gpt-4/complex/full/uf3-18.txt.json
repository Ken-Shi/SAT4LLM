SAT is NP-complete problem where the challenge is to determine if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given boolean formula. \n\nIn the DIMACS format of representation, every number represents a variable in the clause: a positive number for the variable itself and a negative number for not of that variable. \"0\" indicates the end of clause.\n\nLet's decode the given problem, where each line after \"p cnf 3 9\" represents a clause:\n1. Not Variable3 and Not Variable2 or Variable1\n2. Variable1 and Variable2 and Not Variable3\n3. Variable2 and Variable1 and Not Variable3\n4. Variable1 and Variable2 and Not Variable3\n5. Not Variable3 and Not Variable1 or Variable2\n6. Variable2 and Variable3 and Variable1\n7. Variable1 and Variable3 and Variable2\n8. Variable1 and Not Variable3 or Variable2\n9. Variable1 and Variable2 and Not Variable3\n\nNow, let's find an assignment that makes the CNF satisfiable i.e., each clause to be true. \n\nBy looking at the clauses, except for clause 6 and 7, all other clauses can be satisfied if we set Variable3 = false. Now the problem is there are clauses which need Variable3 = true in clause 6 and 7. \n\nBut this can be solved if we set Variable1 = false for clause 6 and Variable2 = false for clause 7. This does not violate the satisfiability of other clauses.\n\nSo, an assignment that satisfies all clauses is Variable1 = false, Variable2 = true, and Variable3 = false.\n\nAnswer: Variable1=false, Variable2=true, Variable3=false"
