                "content": "The given problem is a Boolean Satisfiability problem (also known as a SAT problem) encoded in the DIMACS format. This format is used in many conferences and competitions on this topic, like the annual SAT competition.\n\nHere are the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Each line represents a clause in the CNF, where each clause is a disjunction (OR operation) of literals (variables or their negation). A literal is true if the variable is the same sign as the literal, false otherwise. A clause is true if at least one of its literals is true.\n\n2. Each number in each line represents a variable (1=true, -1=false), except for the zero at the end of the line, which indicates end of a clause.\n\nWith those key understandings, we can go through the clauses:\n\n- `-3 1 2 0` - This means NOT variable 3 OR variable 1 OR variable 2\n- `3 1 2 0` - This means variable 3 OR variable 1 OR variable 2\n- ... and so on\n\nGiven our clauses, let's start assigning possible values:\n\n- We can set Variable 1 as true. The `3 1 2 0`, `1 3 2 0` and `2 3 1 0` will be satisfied. The clause `-3 1 -2 0` is also satisfied as literal 1 is true.\n\n- We can set Variable 2 as false. Clause `-3 1 -2 0` and `1 -2 3 0` will be satisfied as literal -2 is true.\n\n- We can set Variable 3 as false as clause `-3 1 2 0` will be true. Clause `-1 3 -2 0` is satisfied as literal -1 is true.\n\nAfter this assignment, all of the clauses are satisfied, so the formula is satisfiable.\n\nAnswer: Variable 1 = true, Variable 2 = false, Variable 3 = false"
