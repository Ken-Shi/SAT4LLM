The given SAT problem in DIMACS format is a conjunctive normal form (CNF) composed of nine clauses and three variables (1, 2, 3). Here, a positive number represents the presence of a variable, whereas a negative number represents the negation of a variable. The goal of solving a SAT problem is to find an assignment of truth values to variables that satisfies all the clauses.

Clause-by-clause analysis:

- First clause (-3 1 2 0) states that 3 must be FALSE or 1 TRUE or 2 TRUE
- Second clause (3 2 1 0) states that 3 must be TRUE or 2 TRUE or 1 TRUE
- Third clause (-2 3 1 0) states that 2 must be FALSE or 3 TRUE or 1 TRUE
- Fourth clause (3 1 2 0) states that 3 must be TRUE or 1 TRUE or 2 TRUE
- Fifth clause (-2 -1 3 0) states that 2 must be FALSE or 1 must be FALSE or 3 must be TRUE
- Sixth clause (-1 3 2 0) states that 1 must be FALSE or 3 TRUE or 2 TRUE
- Seventh clause (3 1 2 0) states that 3 must be TRUE or 1 TRUE or 2 TRUE
- Eighth clause (-2 1 3 0) states that 2 must be FALSE or 3 TRUE or 1 TRUE
- Ninth clause (1 3 -2 0) states that 1 must be TRUE or 3 TRUE or 2 FALSE

Combining these clauses, we can see that 3 must be TRUE given that it appears as positive in all the clauses. Furthermore, any other value (in 1 or 2) should be TRUE, so they can be either.

Answer: The possible solutions could be: (1, 2, 3) = (TRUE, TRUE, TRUE), (TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), or (FALSE, TRUE, TRUE). In DIMACS format, these solutions would be represented as (1, -1, -1), (1, 1, -1), (-1, 1, -1). Note that 1 means TRUE, and -1 means FALSE.
