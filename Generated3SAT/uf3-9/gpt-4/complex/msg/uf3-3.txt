Step1: DIMACS format is a way to represent a SAT (satisfiability) problem. Each line is a clause. A non-zero digit represents a variable, and negatives represent negations. A zero represents the end of a clause, which is effectively a boolean OR condition, and each clause is combined with each other under a boolean AND condition.

Here, in this SAT problem, we have 3 variables and 9 clauses.

Step2: One way to solve this problem is to use the DPLL (Davis?Putnam?Logemann?Loveland) algorithm for solving the Boolean satisfiability problem.

Step 3: Try a set of variables. Maybe try 1 = true, 2 = true, 3 = false. Now substitute these into all clauses and see if we get a conflict with all of them evaluating to true. Keep track of the substitutions in every clause:

-1 3 2 0 -> F T T = T
3 2 -1 0 -> F T F = T
-1 -2 3 0 -> F F F = F (let's backtrack)
-2 -3 -1 0 -> Invald due to backtrack
-2 3 -1 0 -> Invalid due to backtrack
3 -2 1 0 -> Invalid due to backtrack
-1 3 -2 0 -> Invalid due to backtrack
-1 -2 3 0 -> Invalid due to backtrack
2 -3 -1 0 -> Invalid due to backtrack

Step 4: We have a conflict with 3rd clause, so let's backtrack and try another set of values. 
Let?s try 1 = false, 2 = true, 3 = true. Substitution yields:

-1 3 2 0 -> T T T = T
3 2 -1 0 -> T T F = T
-1 -2 3 0 -> T F T = T
-2 -3 -1 0 -> F F T = T
-2 3 -1 0 -> F T T = T
3 -2 1 0 -> T F F = F (let's backtrack)
-1 3 -2 0 -> Invalid due to backtrack
-1 -2 3 0 -> Invalid due to backtrack
2 -3 -1 0 -> Invalid due to backtrack

Step 5: We have a conflict so we should try another values:
Let?s attempt 1 = true, 2 = true, 3 = true. Substitution yields:

-1 3 2 0 -> F T T = T
3 2 -1 0 -> T T F = T
-1 -2 3 0 -> F F T = T
-2 -3 -1 0 -> F F F = F (let's backtrack)
-2 3 -1 0 -> Invalid due to backtrack
3 -2 1 0 -> Invalid due to backtrack
-1 3 -2 0 -> Invalid due to backtrack
-1 -2 3 0 -> Invalid due to backtrack
2 -3 -1 0 -> Invalid due to backtrack

Step 6 : At this stage, we try again, 1 = false, 2 = true, 3 = false. Substitution yields.

-1 3 2 0 -> T F T = T
3 2 -1 0 -> F T T = T
-1 -2 3 0 -> T F F = T
-2 -3 -1 0 -> F F T = T
-2 3 -1 0 -> F F T = T
3 -2 1 0 -> F F F = F (let's backtrack) 
-1 3 -2 0 -> Invalid due to backtrack
-1 -2 3 0 -> Invalid due to backtrack
2 -3 -1 0 -> Invalid due to backtrack

Step 7: We will try the last option after a lot of backtracking, let's try to assign 1 = true, 2 = false, 3 = true. Substitution yields:

-1 3 2 0 -> F T F = T
3 2 -1 0 -> T F F =T
-1 -2 3 0 -> F T T =T
-2 -3 -1 0 -> T F F = T
-2 3 -1 0 -> T T F =T
3 -2 1 0 -> T T T =T
-1 3 -2 0 -> F T T = T
-1 -2 3 0 -> F T T = T
2 -3 -1 0 -> F F F = F (Backtrack)
There are no more assignments to backtrack. Therefore, the SAT problem is unsolvable.

Finally...

Answer: The SAT problem does not have a solution.
