In this DIMACS format, each clause is written as a row and the variables are represented by numbers. A negative value indicates the negation of that variable and a 0 marks the end of the clause. Here, we have 3 variables and 9 clauses.
 
Let's analyze each clause:

1. 3 2 -1 0 -> This means (var 3 OR var 2 OR NOT var 1) must be TRUE. 
2. 3 2 -1 0 -> This clause is just like the first one, so it gives us no additional information and can be ignored.
3. 2 -1 3 0 -> This means (var 2 OR NOT var 1 OR var 3) must be TRUE.
4. -1 2 3 0 -> This means (NOT var 1 OR var 2 OR var 3) must be TRUE.
5. 3 2 1 0 -> This means (var 3 OR var 2 OR var 1) must be TRUE.
6. -1 2 3 0 -> This clause is the same as the 4th one, so it doesn't give any new information.
7. 3 2 -1 0 -> This repeats the 1st clause and can be ignored.
8. -1 3 2 0 -> This means (NOT var 1 OR var 3 OR var 2) must be TRUE.
9. 3 2 -1 0 -> Repeated 1st clause again.

From the first four unique clauses (clause 1, 3, 4 and 5), we can take var 3 and var 2 as TRUE, because they appear in every clause and are never negated. Now the only variable left is var 1. By choosing var 1 as FALSE, all clauses will be satisfied.

Answer: The solution in DIMACS format would be: 1 -1, 2 1, 3 1. This translates to var 1 being FALSE, and var 2, var 3 being TRUE.
