This problem is an instance of the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) which is a well-known NP-complete problem in computer science. 

The given input is a conjunctive normal form (CNF) formula represented in DIMACS format. The first line specifies that there are 3 variables and 9 clauses in the formula. Each of the following lines is a clause that ends with a 0. The number before the 0 represents the literals in the clause. A positive number n represents the Boolean variable n, and a negative number -n represents the negation of the Boolean variable n.

The problem is to determine if there is an assignment to the Boolean variables that makes the whole formula true. If such assignment exists, the formula is satisfiable; otherwise, it's unsatisfiable.

First, I notice that some clauses have the same literals but in different orders. Since in each clause the literals are connected by OR, the order of literals in the clause doesn't matter.

Let's consider all the clauses collectively:

-1 -2 3 0
3 -1 -2 0
3 -1 -2 0
-2 -1 3 0
2 -3 -1 0
2 3 1 0
1 -2 3 0
-2 -1 3 0
-1 -2 3 0

We can deduce that:

- In the first, fourth, eighth and ninth clauses, at least one of x1's negation, x2's negation, or x3 must be true.
- In the second and third clauses, at least one of x3, x1's negation, or x2's negation must be true.
- In the fifth clause, at least one of x2, x3's negation, or x1's negation must be true.
- In the sixth clause, at least one of x2, x3, or x1 must be true.
- In the seventh clause, at least one of x1, x2's negation, or x3 must be true.

Looking at all this collectively, one can see that assigning the value true to x3, and false to both x1 and x2 would make all these clauses true. To prove this:

- In the first, fourth, eighth and ninth clauses, x3 is true.
- In the second and third clauses, x3 being true suffices.
- In the fifth clause, x2's negation is true as x2 is false.
- In the sixth clause, x3 is true.
- In the seventh clause, x1's negation is true as x1 is false.

answer: x1=false, x2=false, x3=true
