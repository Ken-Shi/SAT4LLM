This problem presents a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem in conjunctive normal form (CNF), specifically, a 3-SAT problem. The 3-SAT problem is a type of problem where given a conjunction of clauses, each containing exactly three literals (variables or their negation), the goal is to find an assignment of TRUE (1) or FALSE (0) to the variables such that all clauses are satisfied.

Here, each number represents a variable (if positive) or the negation of a variable (if negative). For instance, '2' stands for variable 'x_2', '-1' stands for 'NOT x_1'. A '0' denotes the end of a clause.

First, let's rewrite clauses in a more human-friendly way:
1. NOT x1 OR NOT x3 OR x2
2. x3 OR x2 OR x1
3. x2 OR x3 OR NOT x1
4. NOT x1 OR x2 OR x3
5. x3 OR x2 OR NOT x1
6. NOT x1 OR NOT x2 OR x3
7. x2 OR x3 OR NOT x1
8. x3 OR x2 OR NOT x1
9. NOT x1 OR NOT x2 OR x3

We can simplify this system of equations a bit by noting that some of them are repetitive. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8 are identical, as well as 1 and 6, meaning we can remove the duplicates, leaving with:
1. NOT x1 OR NOT x3 OR x2
2. x3 OR x2 OR x1
3. NOT x1 OR NOT x2 OR x3

Now we can start solving. Let's start by assigning x1=FALSE. This satisfies clauses 1 and 3 completely, as we have NOT x1 in both. Then, by assigning x2=TRUE in clause 2, it becomes TRUE as well. There are no contradictions in this solution and therefore, it is valid.

Answer: x1=0, x2=1, x3=0 or alternatively x1=FALSE, x2=TRUE, x3=FALSE
