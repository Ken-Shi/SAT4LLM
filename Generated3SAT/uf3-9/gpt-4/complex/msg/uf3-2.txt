To solve this SAT problem, we'll first understand how the data is formatted.

DIMACS format is a standard for writing down boolean SAT problems (problems about trying to satisfy a set of logical clauses). 'p cnf 3 9' Introduces the problem - it's a problem in conjunctive normal form (CNF) with 3 variables and 9 clauses. The following 9 lines are the clauses, and a clause is ended by value 0.

This is how each clause can be read:
- 3 2 1 0: Can be read as (x3 OR x2 OR x1)
- 2 -3 1 0: Can be read as (x2 OR NOT x3 OR x1)
- 2 3 1 0: Can be read as (x2 OR x3 OR x1)
...
and so on.

Since this problem is quite simple (compared to most real-life SAT problems), let's use a basic approach where we examine the clauses and try to find an assignment of the variables that makes all the clauses true.

First, note that the variable x1 appears in all clauses, always in positive form. So we start by setting x1 = True.

Then, even though we've set a value for x1, let's check the other variables in each clause. All the clauses include either x2 or x3 (or both), so it is enough for us to assign these variables as True. Therefore, setting x2 = True and x3 = True will make the whole set of clauses true, as there are no clauses that prevent us from assigning these variables as such. 

Answer: x1 = True, x2 = True, x3 = True.
