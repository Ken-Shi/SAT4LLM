This problem represents a Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) formula in the DIMACS format consisting of 3 variables and 9 clauses. Each line after "p cnf 3 9" represents a clause, the numbers represent literals and 0 indicates the end of a clause.

The first step is to make sense of the formula.

1. Clause 1: 2 OR 3 OR 1
2. Clause 2: 3 OR 1 OR 2
3. Clause 3: 3 OR 1 OR NOT 2
4. Clause 4: 1 OR NOT 2 OR 3
5. Clause 5: 1 OR NOT 2 OR 3
6. Clause 6: 1 OR 2 OR 3
7. Clause 7: NOT 1 OR 3 OR 2
8. Clause 8: 3 OR 2 OR 1
9. Clause 9: 1 OR 3 OR 2

The next step is to find a combination of truth values for the 3 variables (1, 2, 3) such that each and every clause is satisfied. 

When we analyze the clauses, we find that all 9 clauses contain either the literal '1' or the literal '3' (or both). This tells us that if we assign true values to both 1 and 3, we can satisfy all the clauses, irrespective of what value we assign to variable 2.

So, a possible solution could be:

Variable 1 = true
Variable 2 = either true or false, it doesn't matter
Variable 3 = true

In a more standard SAT solution format, a positive number indicates that the variable should be set to true, and a negative number indicates that the variable should be set to false. In this case, doubt about the variable 2 can be settled by assigning both true or false value to it, as it doesn't affect the conclusion. However, to give a definite solution, let's assign it a true value.

Answer: 
1 -2 3
Signifies that set variable 1 and 3 to true and variable 2 to false.
