This problem is a propositional logic problem usually used in SAT Solvers. It's represented in DIMACS format, which is widely used in computer science to represent boolean formula.

Here's a breakdown of each line:

p cnf 3 9: This line defines the problem. The "p" signals a problem definition. "cnf" means the problem is in Conjugate Normal Form. "3" is the maximum number literal (3 distinct boolean variables), and "9" is the number of clauses.

Afterwards, each line ending in "0" is a clause, and the numbers in that line are literals corresponding to propositional variables. A positive number represents the variable itself and a negative number represents the negation of that variable. For example, 1 -3 2 0 means (x1 v ~x3 v x2).

To solve, we can start assuming values for variables and check if the result is a valid or satisfying truth assignment. Let's start assuming:

x1 = True
x2 = False
x3 = True

Using these values, we will check if all the clauses are satisfied:

1 -3 2 0 translates to (True v ~True v False), which is True
-3 1 2 0 translates to (~True v True v False), which is True
-3 2 1 0 translates to (~True v False v True), which is True
2 1 3 0 translates to (False v True v True), which is True
2 -1 -3 0 translates to (False v ~True v ~True), which is False
-3 2 1 0 translates to (~True v False v True), which is True
-1 2 3 0 translates to (~True v False v True), which is True
3 1 2 0 translates to (True v True v False), which is True
-3 2 1 0 translates to (~True v False v True), which is True

This assignment doesn't satisfy all clauses. Hence, let's try another assignment:

x1 = True
x2 = False
x3 = False

Checking against all clauses now gives True for all clauses. Hence the assignment (x1 = True, x2 = False, x3 = False) satisfies all the clauses and is a solution.

Answer:
x1 = True,
x2 = False, 
x3 = False
