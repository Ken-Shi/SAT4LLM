This problem is presented in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) using the DIMACS standard. 

Here is how it works:
The first line declares the problem, where 'p' indicates this is a problem, 'cnf' is the type of the problem (in this case, a boolean satisfiability problem in conjunctive normal form), '3' is the number of variables, and '9' is the number of clauses.

Each subsequent line is a clause in the problem. Every clause is a disjunction ("or") of literals (variables or their negation). For instance the first line -2 -1 3 0 means (-2 OR -1 OR 3) where -2 means NOT 2 etc.

We are to find assignments to the variables numbered 1 to 3 that satisfy all of the clauses, or determine that it is not possible.

So here is one by one:
- The first and second clause both mean "either 1 false, 2 false or 3 true".
- The third clause means "either 1 true, 2 true or 3 false".
- The fourth clause means "either 1 true, 2 false or 3 false".
- The fifth clause means "either 1 false, 2 false or 3 false".
- The last four clauses all mean "either 1 false, 2 false or 3 true".

From this, we can see that if we set both 1 and 2 to be false, that is -1 and -2, then 3 must be true to satisfy the first, second, and last four clauses. However, 3 being true doesn't contradict the third, fourth, and fifth clauses, so that makes it a valid assignment.

answer: 1=false, 2=false, 3=true. In convention of SAT results, we can also represent this solution as -1 -2 3.
