This SAT problem is given in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), encoded in DIMACS format. The problem is to find an interpretation that satisfies the conjunction of the listed clauses. It involves three variables and nine clauses.

The numbers represent the variables and the sign before a number represents the negation or normal form of the variable. Each clause is terminated by "0". So, for instance, `-3 2 1 0` represents the clause NOT(variable 3) OR (variable 2) OR (variable 1). The whole CNF formula is the conjunction (AND) of all the clauses.

For this type of problem, you can use a SAT solver. However, this problem is small enough that you can solve it manually. 

The process of manually solving this SAT problem involves attempting to satisfy one clause at a time by setting variables to either true or false and subsequently checking whether the remaining clauses can still be satisfied. 

From the `1 -2 3 0` and `2 1 -3 0` clauses, we can see that variable 1 does not appear negated, and it is required to be `1` (True) in order to satisfy each clause. On the other hand, variable 2 appears negated in `1 -2 3 0` clause and in normal form in other clauses, so it is conflicting and does not give consistent truth value. 

Finally, variable 3 appears as `-3` in most of the clauses, and if we set it as `0` (False), these clauses will be satisfied. However, `1 2 3 0` and `1 -3 2 0` clauses also have positive `3`, but because `1` (variable 1) is true in both those clauses as well, these also are satisfied.

So, the values for each variable can be: 
 1 -> True
 2 -> Both True and False
 3 -> False

Some ways to express the solution:
As a dictionary: {1: True, 2: [True, False], 3: False} 

Or as an enumerated list:
 1. True
 2. Both True and False
 3. False

However, in many SAT solver implementations, the convention used is to represent true as '1', false as '0', and any variables that can take either value as 'X' or 'both', we use 'X' to denote both here.

Answer: 1 X 0 
This represents that Variable 1 is True, Variable 2 can be True or False, and Variable 3 is False.
