This problem is given in DIMACS format, which is one of the standard ways to represent a boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). 

The first row in the input gives some information about the problem itself. The first number after "p cnf" indicates how many variables are in the problem (3 in this case), and the second number gives the number of clauses (9 in this case). After that, each row represents a clause, with each number represents a variable. Variables are positive if they are not complemented and negative if they are. Each clause is a disjunction of literals (a variable or its complement), and the whole problem represents the conjunction of all clauses. "0" marks the end of a clause.

This problem, therefore, has 3 variables and 9 clauses. The task is to find an assignment to the variables such that every clause is true (evaluating to 1).

To solve this problem, one strategy could be trial and error: trying all possible assignments to the variables and checking which one satisfies all the clauses. But here, the number of variables is small, we can go with trial and error:

Let's try the first combination:
1 = False, 2 = False, 3 = False
The clauses 1, 2 and 5 are not satisfied. So, that can not be our solution.

Next combination:
1 = True, 2 = False, 3 = False
The clauses 3 and 6 are not satisfied. This can not be our answer as well.

Next combination:
1 = False, 2 = True, 3 = False
The first clause is not satisfied.

Next combination:
1 = True, 2 = True, 3 = False
The clauses 5 and 6 are not satisfied.

Next combination:
1 = False, 2 = False, 3 = True
All the clauses are satisfied.

So, the solution for this problem is 1 = False, 2 = False, 3 = True.

Answer: 1 = False, 2 = False, 3 = True
