To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use the WalkSAT algorithm which randomly initializes a truth assignment and then iteratively flips the value of variables to minimize the number of unsatisfied clauses.

Here is the solution we obtained using the WalkSAT algorithm:

answer: 1 -2 3 4 5
