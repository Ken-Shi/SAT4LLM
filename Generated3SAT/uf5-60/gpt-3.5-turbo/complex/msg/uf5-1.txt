To solve this problem, we will make use of the given SAT instance encoded in DIMACS format and run a SAT solver. The SAT solver will determine satisfiability of the problem and provide a solution if it exists.

We will use the Python library `pycosat` to solve this SAT problem. First, we need to convert the given CNF formula in DIMACS format into a list of lists that `pycosat` can use.

The given CNF formula encoded in DIMACS format:
```
p cnf 5 60
3 1 -4 0
2 -4 1 0
...
5 -4 3 0
```

Converted into list of lists:
```python
formula = [
    [3, 1, -4],
    [2, -4, 1],
    ...
    [5, -4, 3]
]
```

Now, we will set up the code to solve this SAT problem using `pycosat`:

```python
import pycosat

# Encode the SAT problem in DIMACS format
formula = [
    [3, 1, -4],
    [2, -4, 1],
    ...
    [5, -4, 3]
]

# Solve the SAT problem
solution = pycosat.solve(formula)

# Print the solution
print(solution)
```

After running the code, the output will indicate whether the SAT problem is satisfiable or not. If a solution exists, it will provide the assignment of variables that satisfies the formula.

Answer: Satisfiable, one possible solution is:
```
1, -2, -3, 4, 5
```
