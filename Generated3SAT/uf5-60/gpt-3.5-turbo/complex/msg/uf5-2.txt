To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to first understand what the problem is asking for. In this case, we have a SAT problem with 5 variables and 60 clauses. We will try to find a satisfying assignment for these variables.

Next, we can represent the problem in a more readable format:
1. (5, -3, -4)
2. (-4, -1, 5)
3. (5, -4, 2)
4. (2, -4, 5)
5. (-2, -3, 5)
6. (-4, 2, -1)
7. (-3, -4, -1)
8. (2, -3, -4)
9. (5, 1, 2)
10. (-1, -3, 2)
...

We will now try to find a satisfying assignment for this problem. Let's start solving this problem:

Since the problem has 5 variables, we will try all possible combinations of truth values for these variables and check which combination satisfies all the clauses.

After checking all combinations, we find that the following truth assignment satisfies all the clauses:

1. Variable 1 is FALSE
2. Variable 2 is TRUE
3. Variable 3 is FALSE
4. Variable 4 is TRUE
5. Variable 5 is TRUE

Therefore, the satisfying assignment for this SAT problem is:
answer: -1 2 -3 4 5
