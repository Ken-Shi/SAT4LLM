To solve the SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm.

Given CNF formula:
(p cnf 5 60
-4 5 2 0
2 -1 4 0
2 -1 3 0
4 -2 5 0
4 5 3 0
4 -1 5 0

The DPLL algorithm iterates through a series of steps to determine the satisfiability of the CNF formula. The steps involve unit propagation, pure literal elimination, and splitting.

Here is the process while solving the given CNF formula:

Step 1: Based on initial unit propagation:
- We find that the literal 1 can be assigned True, which leads to the propagation of many other literals.

Step 2: Further unit propagation:
- From the assignments resulting from Step 1, we find other unit propogations. 

Step 3: Remaining variables in the CNF formula:
- The CNF formula can now be simplified to a point where only a few choice assignments are required to satisfy the formula.

Final Answer:
answer: 1 -2 5 3 4.
