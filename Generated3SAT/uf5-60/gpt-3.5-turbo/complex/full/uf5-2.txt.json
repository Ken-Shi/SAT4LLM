In this case, we have a SAT problem with 5 variables and 60 clauses. We will try to find a satisfying assignment for these variables.\n\nNext, we can represent the problem in a more readable format:\n1. (5, -3, -4)\n2. (-4, -1, 5)\n3. (5, -4, 2)\n4. (2, -4, 5)\n5. (-2, -3, 5)\n6. (-4, 2, -1)\n7. (-3, -4, -1)\n8. (2, -3, -4)\n9. (5, 1, 2)\n10. (-1, -3, 2)\n...\n\nWe will now try to find a satisfying assignment for this problem. Let's start solving this problem:\n\nSince the problem has 5 variables, we will try all possible combinations of truth values for these variables and check which combination satisfies all the clauses.\n\nAfter checking all combinations, we find that the following truth assignment satisfies all the clauses:\n\n1. Variable 1 is FALSE\n2. Variable 2 is TRUE\n3. Variable 3 is FALSE\n4. Variable 4 is TRUE\n5. Variable 5 is TRUE\n\nTherefore, the satisfying assignment for this SAT problem is:\nanswer: -1 2 -3 4 5"
