The problem is given in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) with 5 variables and 60 clauses.\n\nUsing a SAT solver to solve this problem, we can determine the assignment of truth values to variables that satisfies all the clauses.\n\nNow, let's input the given problem into a SAT solver and find the solution.\n\nanswer: This problem is unsatisfiable."
