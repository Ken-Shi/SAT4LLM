The SAT problem given in DIMACS format is a Boolean satisfiability problem. DIMACS format defines the problem's variables, which are numbers 1 to 5 in this problem, and restrictions, which are the lines of numbers followed by a 0. Each condition either requires that a variable be True or False to solve the problem.

The algorithm process :
1. Initialize variables based on the problem. Variables 1 to 5.
2. Loop through the list of conditions.
3. For every condition, iterate through all variables in the condition.
4. Check if the variable has a negative sign or not. If it has, the variable should be False in the solution; otherwise, it should be True.
5. If a variable clashes with its value in the previous constraints, do adjustments. 
6. Repeat until no constraints are violated.

After running the above algorithm, we get the following values for variables:

1: True
2: True
3: False
4: False
5: True

This solution satisfies all the conditions given in the problem.

Answer: 1 -2 -3 -4 5
