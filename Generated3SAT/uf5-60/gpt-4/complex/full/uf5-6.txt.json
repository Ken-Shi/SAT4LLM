                "content": "Let's try a brute force method, setting the literals to T or F and checking the clauses to find a solution.\n\nFirst, let's understand the DIMACS format. 'p cnf 5 60' means we have 5 variables and 60 clauses. Each line after that with the '0' at the end is a clause. Each number is a literal: if the number is positive, the literal is true; if the number is negative, literal is false.\n\nNow, let's set all literals (1-5) to True (T). \n\n- First clause: not 1 or 4 or 2\nThis is satisfied since 4 and 2 are True.\n\nWe keep checking every clause with all literals being True. \n\nOnce we reach clause 18: 5, not 2, not 1\nThis is not satisfied if 2 and 1 are set to True.\n\nThis means we need to adjust our literals. So, let's set literal 2 to False (F). \n\n- Checking clause 18 again: 5, not 2, not 1\nNow, this is satisfied since 2 is False and 5 is True.\n\nContinuing this process of checking each clause, we find that clauses like '5 -3 -1' are not satisfied because literal 3 is set to be True. Notice that we could have also started checking with all literals as False (F), or a mix of True and False values.\n\nSo, we adjust literal 3 to False (F).\n\nFollowing this trial-and-error process, we end up with the following configuration:\n\nLiteral 1 - True\nLiteral 2 - False\nLiteral 3 - False\nLiteral 4 - True\nLiteral 5 - True\n\nThis configuration of literals (1=T, 2=F, 3=F, 4=T, 5=T) makes all the clauses True, which solves this SAT problem.\n\nTherefore,\n\nAnswer: 1=T, 2=F, 3=F, 4=T, 5=T."
