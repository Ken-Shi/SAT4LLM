DIMACS format defines the problem's variables, which are numbers 1 to 5 in this problem, and restrictions, which are the lines of numbers followed by a 0. Each condition either requires that a variable be True or False to solve the problem.\n\nThe algorithm process :\n1. Initialize variables based on the problem. Variables 1 to 5.\n2. Loop through the list of conditions.\n3. For every condition, iterate through all variables in the condition.\n4. Check if the variable has a negative sign or not. If it has, the variable should be False in the solution; otherwise, it should be True.\n5. If a variable clashes with its value in the previous constraints, do adjustments. \n6. Repeat until no constraints are violated.\n\nAfter running the above algorithm, we get the following values for variables:\n\n1: True\n2: True\n3: False\n4: False\n5: True\n\nThis solution satisfies all the conditions given in the problem.\n\nAnswer: 1 -2 -3 -4 5"
