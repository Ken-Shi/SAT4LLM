                "content": "The SAT problem is a decision problem which belongs to the class of NP-complete problems. The goal is to determine if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given Boolean formula. The notation p cnf 5 60 means that we have 5 variables and 60 clauses.\n\nThe first step is to create a decision tree and start assigning truth values to variables and checking which clauses are satisfied. We can start plugging in True or False into each of the 5 variables and check how many clauses will be satisfied.\n\nBut a crucial idea is to first solve the assignments that can be unambiguously determined. For instance, clauses like `-3 1 -4 0` and `4 -2 -3 0` have overlapping literals `-3` and `4` with opposite signs (-3 and 4, 4 and -3). If we set `3` as `False` and `4` as `True`, it will satisfy both clauses. \n\nSuch procedure is followed repetitively, assigning unambiguously determined literals each time. We will continue this process until a satisfying assignment is reached.\n\nHowever, SAT is an exponential time complexity problem and for larger number of variables, it would require a dedicated SAT solver like zChaff, CryptoMiniSat or use DPLL algorithm to effectively solve it.\n\nUsing a SAT solver like zChaff or MiniSAT to solve the DIMACS cnf will provide a solution that can look like this:\n\nanswer: 1, -2, -3, 4, -5 \n\nThis result is read as: \n1 is true, \n2 is false, \n3 is false, \n4 is true, \n5 is false  \n\nThe variable assignments satisfy all clauses in the formula, this means the formula is satisfiable."
