In this format, the first line \"p cnf 5 36\" indicates that there are 5 variables and 36 clauses in the problem. Each subsequent line represents a clause, with the numbers indicating the literals (variables) and ending with a 0.\n\nNext, we can proceed with applying a SAT solver to the given set of clauses, to check if a satisfying assignment exists.\n\nanswer: SATISFIABLE"
