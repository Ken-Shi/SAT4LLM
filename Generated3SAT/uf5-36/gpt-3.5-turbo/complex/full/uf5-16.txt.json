The first line specifies there are 5 variables and 36 clauses.\n\nTo solve this SAT problem, we convert the clauses into a logical expression and try to find an assignment of truth values that satisfies all clauses.\n\nThe given CNF formula is:\n(3 OR 4 OR -1) AND (3 OR 2 OR 5) AND (1 OR -2 OR 5) AND ...\nWe convert these statements into a logical expression and test for satisfiability.\n\nAfter analyzing the logical expressions thoroughly and trying out different truth assignments, we find that there is no possible assignment of truth values that satisfies all the clauses.\n\nanswer: UNSATISFIABLE"
