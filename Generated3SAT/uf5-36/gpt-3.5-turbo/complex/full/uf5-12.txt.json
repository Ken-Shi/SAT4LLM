Once the solver finds a solution, we can interpret the variables that are set to true as the solution to the problem.\n\nHere is a possible solution after running the solver:\n\n1. Variable 1 is true\n2. Variable 2 is false\n3. Variable 3 is true\n4. Variable 4 is false\n5. Variable 5 is true\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nanswer: 1 -2 3 -4 5"
