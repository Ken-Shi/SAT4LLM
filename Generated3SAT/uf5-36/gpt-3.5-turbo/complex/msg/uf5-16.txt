This problem is in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) in DIMACS format. The first line specifies there are 5 variables and 36 clauses.

To solve this SAT problem, we convert the clauses into a logical expression and try to find an assignment of truth values that satisfies all clauses.

The given CNF formula is:
(3 OR 4 OR -1) AND (3 OR 2 OR 5) AND (1 OR -2 OR 5) AND ...
We convert these statements into a logical expression and test for satisfiability.

After analyzing the logical expressions thoroughly and trying out different truth assignments, we find that there is no possible assignment of truth values that satisfies all the clauses.

answer: UNSATISFIABLE
