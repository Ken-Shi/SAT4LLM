To solve the SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm which is a backtracking search algorithm. We will try to find a satisfying assignment for the given clauses.

Here are the steps we will follow:
1. Convert the DIMACS format to a more readable format.
2. Apply the DPLL algorithm to find a satisfying assignment.

Converting DIMACS format:
-1 2 3 0 -> (~1 v 2 v 3)
-4 2 -1 0 -> (~4 v 2 v ~1)
-1 2 -3 0 -> (~1 v 2 v ~3)
3 5 -4 0 -> (3 v 5 v ~4)
-1 -4 -5 0 -> (~1 v ~4 v ~5)
2 5 -1 0 -> (2 v 5 v ~1)
...

Now we will apply the DPLL algorithm to find a satisfying assignment.

answer: The SAT problem is satisfiable, and one possible satisfying assignment is:
1. TRUE
2. TRUE
3. TRUE
4. FALSE
5. FALSE
