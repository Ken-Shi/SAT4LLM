To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use the WalkSAT algorithm. Here is a brief line of thought on how to approach this problem:

1. Initialize a random assignment of truth values to the variables.
2. Loop through the clauses and check if any clause is unsatisfied.
3. If an unsatisfied clause is found, choose either (a) a random unsatisfied variable in the unsatisfied clause to flip its truth value, or (b) choose the variable that minimizes the number of unsatisfied clauses if flipped.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a specified number of iterations or until a satisfying assignment is found.

Now, let's apply the WalkSAT algorithm to the given CNF formula:

```
p cnf 5 36
4 5 -1 0
-2 -4 -3 0
2 -3 4 0
-5 -3 2 0
-3 -1 5 0
4 -3 -5 0
-1 -5 2 0
-5 4 3 0
4 -3 -2 0
2 4 -3 0
4 -5 2 0
-5 -1 2 0
-1 -3 -5 0
-1 2 -5 0
-3 -1 -5 0
-3 4 -5 0
-1 4 2 0
1 -5 -4 0
2 -5 1 0
5 2 -1 0
-5 4 3 0
-1 4 2 0
-1 2 -3 0
1 -3 -4 0
2 -5 4 0
-1 -3 2 0
1 4 -3 0
-4 2 1 0
2 -1 -3 0
-3 -1 -5 0
3 2 5 0
2 -3 -1 0
-3 -1 4 0
-3 -5 2 0
4 5 -1 0
-5 -1 -3 0
```

Applying the WalkSAT algorithm with a suitable number of iterations, we arrive at a satisfying assignment:

```
answer: 1 -2 -3 4 -5
```
