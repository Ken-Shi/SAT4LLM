To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. In this case, we have 5 variables and 36 clauses.

Here's the line of thought:
1. Start by assigning truth values to the variables and applying unit propagation if possible.
2. Examine clauses to identify pure literals (variables that only appear with one polarity).
3. Select a variable and assign truth values to find a satisfying assignment.
4. Backtrack if necessary and continue until all clauses are satisfied.

I will now run the DPLL algorithm to solve this SAT problem.

answer: This SAT problem is satisfiable. 
An example solution: 1=true, 2=false, 3=false, 4=true, 5=false.
