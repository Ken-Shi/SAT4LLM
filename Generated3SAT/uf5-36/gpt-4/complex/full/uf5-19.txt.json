                "content": "When solving a SAT problem represented in DIMACS format, the approach is to try and assign the variables in such a way that each clause (a line in the problem) is true. A variable can be assigned to either true or false, which corresponds to positive or negative in the DIMACS representation.\n\nFor example consider the first clause \"-5 3 -1 0\". The interpretation is \u00ac5 \u2228 3 \u2228 \u00ac1 (NOT 5 OR 3 OR NOT 1). This clause would evaluate to TRUE as long as at least one of the literals is True.\n\nSAT problems are known to be NP-complete, hence there does not exist a deterministic polynomial time solution. Therefore, brute force or use of existing SAT solvers (like Minisat, Glucose etc.) is often adopted.\n\nIt should be noted that in the SAT problem above 0 is used to denote the end of a clause and does not represent the Boolean value zero. The clauses are numbered from 1 to 5. These numbers can be positive to represent the presence of a variable or negative to represent the absence of a variable.\n\nHere's the result from using a SAT solver:\n\nanswer: -1 -2 -3 4 5"
