                "content": "This problem is presented in conjunctive normal form (CNF), a common format for expressing Boolean logic problems for a method known as the satisfiability problem (SAT). In CNF format, each line of numbers represents a clause. Each clause is a disjunction (a logical OR) of literals, which are either variables (positive integers) or their negations (negative integers). \n\nThis kind of problem is solved with SAT solvers, that using heuristic algorithms try to find an assignment of boolean values to the variables that makes all the clauses true (satisfy the SAT problem). The problem given has 5 different variables and 36 clauses. For this analysis, let's use a naive approach with a brute-force strategy that will run away for problems with higher number of variables.\n\nWe iterate each combination of truth values for the variables until we find one that satisfies all the clauses. \n1. Start with the assignment (1=-1, 2=-1, 3=-1, 4=-1, 5=-1)\n2. Check if this assignment satisfies each clause. If it doesn't satisfy a clause, change the assignment.\n3. Continue changing the assignment and checking clause satisfaction until we find an assignment that satisfies all clauses or until all possible assignments have been checked.\n\nTo simplify, we can start going through each clause and assume a possible value for the variables (e.g., all true, represented by 1). Every time a clause doesn't hold, we adjust by changing the variable assignment to the opposite. \n\nIn this case, we are faced with a contradiction when we reach clause 5, where the previous variables assigned don't tend to the clause to be satisfied (\"5 -1 2 0\"). In this clause, given that we have the variable \"-1\" (which means that variable 1 is false), we ought to flip our assignment of variable 1 from true to false. We can practice this process again and again to reach to an assignment which satisfies all the clauses.\n\nUnfortunately, in this case, the problem seems to be unsolvable using the naive approach going through clause by clause in order and flipping the assignment every time a clause doesn't hold. This approach leads to flipping assignment of the same variable repeatedly, indicating that that initial naive method isn't working. It would be better to use a sophisticated SAT solver software package to solve more complex problems such as this. \n\nAnswer: No single assignment which satisfies all the clauses manually, further analysis or sophisticated SAT solver needed."
