A SAT (Boolean satisfiability problem) problem is a decision problem, the task is to determine if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given Boolean formula. Here, the SAT problem is provided in DIMACS format which is a standard format used to represent these problems.

Methodology:
- Every line represents a clause in the constraint.
- Variables are represented by integers from 1 to 5 corresponding to v1, v2, ..., v5.
- The constraints are represented as disjunctions (OR) of literals (a variable or its negation). 
- A negative number represents the negation of a variable.
- The number '0' denotes the end of a clause.

Applying a SAT solver, which uses DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) algorithm, a type of backtracking search algorithm, we can find if this CNF can be satisfied and determine the possible assignments.

Answer: 
After applying the SAT Solver, we can see that there is a solution which satisfies all clauses. The solution is: 

v1 = False,
v2 = True,
v3 = False,
v4 = True,
v5 = True.

The solved DIMACS format solution will be: 

Answer: -1 2 -3 4 5 

This means:
-1: v1 is False
2: v2 is True
-3: v3 is False 
4: v4 is True
5: v5 is True

This means that this SAT problem is satisfiable under these conditions.
