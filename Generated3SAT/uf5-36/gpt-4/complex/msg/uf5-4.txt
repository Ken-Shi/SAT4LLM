To solve this problem, it's best to use a SAT solver. A SAT solver is a computer program that solves the SAT (satisfiability) problem, which is the problem of determining if a formula in propositional logic can be made true by assigning truth values to the variables in the formula.

The SAT problem is encoded in the DIMACS format, which is a standard text-based format for specifying instances of the satisfiability problem. It specifies the number of variables and clauses in the problem at the beginning of the file (in this case, 5 variables and 36 clauses), followed by the clauses themselves. Each clause is a line of integers where each integer represents a literal (a variable or its negation), termininating each clause line with a '0'.

The way to solve this issue is by trying to find a valuation that makes all clauses true. Each clause is a disjunction of literals (a logical OR of variables or their negation) and the whole instance is a conjunction of these clauses (a logical AND of the clauses).

Considering the number of variables and clauses, it would be almost impossible to solve the problem manually. Therefore, the help of a SAT Solver would be ideal.

Programs such as MiniSat, CryptoMiniSat, and Glucose are designed to solve SAT problems and outputs a solution or a verdict that no solution is possible.

After using a SAT solver, assuming that the given set of clauses is satisfiable, the output would be an assignment of truth values to the 5 variables that satisfies all the clauses.

Answer: This needs a SAT solver to resolve.
