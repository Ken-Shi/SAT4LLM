When solving a SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, the aim is to assign a Boolean value (either true or false) to each variable such that every clause has at least one variable whose assigned value makes it true. Here's how we can go about it:

- Each line represents a clause, and each number is a variable. A positive number represents a positive literal (variable) and a negative number is a negative literal (negation of a variable).
- The zero at the end of each line indicates the end of that clause. It is not considered as a variable itself.

Let's try to solve it:

1. Are there any unit clauses (i.e., clause consisting of just one literal)? No.
2. Are there any pure literals (i.e., a variable with the same sign in every clause where it appears)? Yes, 5 is pure, it appears as positive in all clauses where it appears. Hence we can append 5=true to our solution.
3. Are there any repeated literals in the clauses which can aid in our process? Yes, 4 is in 16 clauses, 3 is in 15 clauses, and -2 is in 10 clauses. 

We can use this information to perform the so-called picking a split variable strategy ?valuating a variable that appears in most of the clauses? to reduce the number of clauses. Let's start with 4=true. This will reduce our formula to:

1 -2 5 0
-2 5 0
-2 -1 0
1 5 3 0
-1 -5 0
-2 3 -1 0
-2 3 -1 0
-1 3 -5 0
-1 5 0
-1 3 0
5 -1 3 0
-2 0
-2 -1 3 0
-2 5 3 0
3 -2 5 0
-2 3 5 0

Notice that we got a couple of pure literals, -2. So, -2=true.

Resulting in,

1 5 0
5 0
-1 0
1 5 3 0
-1 -5 0
3 -1 0
3 -1 0
-1 3 -5 0
-1 5 0
-1 3 0
5 -1 3 0
-1 3 0
5 3 0
3 5 0
3 5 0

We can again simply choose to make 1=true. Now we are left with:

5 0
-5 0
-5 0
3 -5 0
3 0
3 0
5 3 0
3 5 0
3 5 0

There are clauses which are contradictory: 5 0 and -5 0?this cannot be satisfied. Thus, the original formula was unsatisfiable.

answer: unsatisfiable
