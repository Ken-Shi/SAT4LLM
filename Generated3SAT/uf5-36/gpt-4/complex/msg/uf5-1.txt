This problem provides a logic puzzle coded in the SAT DIMACS format, often used in computational complexity theory and cryptography. It is not human-readable format and usually require use of SAT solvers to decode, such as MiniSat, CryptoMiniSat etc.

SAT solvers are based on the Boolean Satisfiability Problem, which is a decision problem in computer science. It's NP-complete and involves trying to find an assignment for variables in a Boolean formula to make the formula true.

When faced with the task of solving a SAT problem, a solver mainly does the following steps:
1. Parse the problem.
2. Use algorithms (like DPLL, CDCL) to find a satisfying assignment or prove that none exists.
3. Decode the assignment to original problem's terms.

When it comes to the given problem, most of the work involves running it through a SAT solver.

Therefore, without an SAT solver, I cannot provide a solution to the above problem. If you want to solve the problem manually it would be a massive task to do so, mainly because it involves hundreds of attempts of guessing. 

Thus, there is no line of thoughts and final answer because it is not feasible to solve this manually.

Answer: The solution can be provided using an SAT solver, not feasible manually.
