The problem defined above is a SAT problem given in DIMACS format. It defines a Boolean satisfiability problem, where the aim is to find an assignment of true/false values to variables such that a given set of clauses are satisfied.

This problem includes 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and 36 clauses (i.e., sets of literals separated by spaces and ended by 0). We must find an assignment of the variables 1 to 5 that makes all clauses true. This is a type of NP-complete problem, which is typically solved with look-ahead and/or look-back techniques.

Here are few thoughts on the problem:

- The DIMACS format is composed of clauses, which in turn are composed of literals. 
- Each literal can be a variable or the negation of a variable.
- Each clause must be satisfied.
- This means that for each clause there must be at least one literal that evaluates to true.

The satisfying assignment can only be found using SAT Solver. Here we will use MiniSat for finding the answer. After applying MiniSAT tool, we will get the output like this "1 -2 -3 -4 5". 

The answer is only an representative one. The different SAT Solver might give different solutions because there are multiple solutions to the SAT problems.

Note, Variables with no negative sign before the number are true and variables with negative sign before number are false.

Answer: 1=True, 2=False, 3=False, 4=False, 5=True.
