The given problem consists of 36 conjunctive normal form (CNF) clauses with 5 variables. The problem is in DIMACS format, a commonly used standard for specifying instances of a boolean satisfiability problem.
The goal of the problem is to find an assignment of true(1) or false(-1) to each of the 5 variables such that each clause is satisfied. 

A possible technique to solve this problem, is the Davis Putnam Logemann Loveland (DPLL). The DPLL algorithm is a recursive and backtracking algorithm that tries to determine the values of the variables to satisfy the formula.

Goal: To assign 1 or -1 to each variable to satisfy the clauses:

Let's try a top-down approach. We will go down assigning 1 (true) to each variable and if a conflict arises, we'll backtrack assigning them -1.

Starting with the first variable:

1. Set 1 to true(1). 

Upon checking the clauses, we see that there is no conflict with 1 set to true. Hereafter we will move onto the next variable 2.

2. Set 2 to true(1).

Checking clauses we come across, '2 -1 -4 0', which is a clear conflict if 2 is true. As such, we backtrack and set 2 to -1.

3. Set 3 to true(1).

No conflicts are seen by checking the clauses. Moving on.

4. Set 4 to -1.

No conflicts are seen by checking the clauses. We choose -1 because there are a lot of conflicts related to 4.

5. Set 5 to true(1).

Checking clauses, there are no conflicts observed.

Analyzing the clauses under the given variable values, we see that all the clauses are satisfied.

Answer: 1 1, 2 -1, 3 1, 4 -1, 5 1
