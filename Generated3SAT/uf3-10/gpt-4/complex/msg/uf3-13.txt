The SAT problem is a Boolean satisfiability problem and the problem you've mentioned above seems to be in conjunctive normal form (CNF) format represented in DIMACS. Each line after the first line represents a disjunctive clause where a 0 (zero) at the end denotes the end of the clause. It means, for each line at least one of the literals (which are here the integers - either positive or negative) should hold true under some assignment for the problem to be satisfiable. 

Let's break down each line and consider all the clauses:

1) -2 1 -3 0: This means either variable 2 is False, or variable 1 is True, or variable 3 is False.

2) -3 1 -2 0: This means either variable 3 is False, or variable 1 is True, or variable 2 is False.

3) -2 3 -1 0: This means either variable 2 is False, or variable 3 is True, or variable 1 is False.

4) -3 2 1 0: This means either variable 3 is False, or variable 2 is True, or variable 1 is True.

5) -2 -3 1 0: This means either variable 2 is False, or variable 3 is False, or variable 1 is True.

6) -2 1 -3 0: Same as clause 1.

7) -3 -2 1 0: This means either variable 3 is False, or variable 2 is False, or variable 1 is True.

8) -3 -2 1 0: Same as clause 7.

9) -2 1 -3 0: Same as clause 1.

10) 3 1 -2 0: This means either variable 3 is True, or variable 1 is True, or variable 2 is False.

After analyzing each clause, it seems that each clause can be satisfied when we assign True to variable 1, False to variable 2 and True to variable 3. 

Answer: 1 = True, 2 = False, 3 = True
