The problem given is a Boolean satisfiability problem, the class of problems that the SAT solving algorithms solve.

Firstly, we should explain the structure of this CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form). The header "p cnf 3 10" means that there are 3 variables (labelled 1, 2, and 3) and 10 clauses. The CNF problem is presented as a list of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction of literals (a literal is a variable or a negation of a variable). The entire CNF formula is the conjunction of these clauses.

Now we'll apply a couple of strategies to solve the problem:

1. Unit Propagation.
2. Pure Literal Elimination.

1. Unit Propagation: This procedure looks for singleton clauses (clauses with only one literal) and assigns the value to this literal that makes the clause true.

Looking at the problem, we don't seem to have any singleton clauses.

2. Pure Literal Elimination: This procedure looks for literals that always appear with the same polarity, either positive or negative, throughout the CNF formula. If such a literal exists, we can make the entire CNF formula true by assigning the value to this literal that makes all clauses containing this literal true.

Looking at the problem, we don't seem to have any pure literals either.

3. As the preliminary strategies didn't simplify the problem, we'll move on to a recursive search procedure, also known as backtracking.

Take the first variable 1. Let's assume it's true. Then, the clauses (2 -1 3 0), (2 -1 -3 0), (-3 2 -1 0), (-1 2 -3 0), and (-3 2 -1 0) are satisfied and removed. This leaves us with:

2 -3 0
2 -3 0
2 -3 0
-3 2 1 0
-2 -3 1 0

Now we move to the second variable (2). If we assume it is true, all clauses except one are satisfied. This leaves us with:
-2 -3 1 0

Finally, we give the remaining two variables 3 and 1 the values that satisfy this clause. By giving 3 the value False and 1 the value True, we satisfy all clauses.

Therefore, the assignment (1=True, 2=True, 3=False) helps us satisfy all given clauses making this satisfiability problem solvable.

answer: 1 -2 3
