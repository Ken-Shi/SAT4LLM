The task requires solving a propositional logic problem in conjunctive normal form (CNF) using the SAT solver. The problem is given in DIMACS format. DIMACS is a standard text-based format for specifying Boolean expressions in conjunctive normal form, widely used by education and research organizations. 

The given problem has three different variables that can be 1 (true) or 0 (false). The lines after the first line are the clauses which are in the form of separate lines ending with 0. Each line can be read as a statement of "OR" logic between the variables denoted by their numbers; the negative sign in front of a number means that the variable value is negated ("NOT" operation).

The problem can be solved by assigning true or false to the variables and checking if the final result satisfies all clauses. 

Let's convert the clauses to their logical equivalents to understand the problem better:

1. 3 OR 2 OR 1
2. 1 OR 3 OR 2
3. 1 OR ~2 OR 3
4. 1 OR 3 OR 2
5. 3 OR ~2 OR 1
6. 3 OR 1 OR 2
7. ~1 OR 3 OR 2
8. 3 OR 2 OR 1
9. ~1 OR 3 OR 2
10. 3 OR 2 OR ~1

Each of these clauses must be true for a solution to the SAT problem. 

We observe from clauses 7, 9 and 10 that, regardless of the values of other variables, these can only be satisfied if variable 3 is set to true.

By setting variable 3 to true, we also satisfy clauses 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8, this makes clause 3 the only remaining clause that is not satisfied. 

Clause 3 can be made true by either setting variable 1 to true or variable 2 to false. 

So, 
- variable 1 can be either true or false 
- variable 2 is false
- variable 3 is true 

Answer: Based on the given conditions and steps, a possible solution for the SAT problem can be: 
1 = True , 2 = False , 3 = True
