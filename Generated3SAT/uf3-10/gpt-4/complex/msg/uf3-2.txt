This is a SAT problem presented in DIMACS format. It contains three variables (1, 2, 3) and ten clauses, each of which is a disjunction of literals (a literal being either a variable or its negation).

Here's my step-by-step approach to solving this:

1. I'll start with assuming variable 1 is true (denoted as "1").
2. Looking at the clauses, the first one (2 3 -1 0) is satisfied already since we assumed 1 to be true, and -1 is present in the clause.
3. The second clause is (-3 -1 -2 0). This clause is also satisfied as it contains -1.
4. The next clause is (-2 3 -1 0), which is also satisfied for the same reason.
5. This goes on until the last clause, because all the clauses contain -1.

Let's now verify whether the solution fits all the clauses if we substitute 1 as True, 2 as False, and 3 as False. 

- In the first clause (2 3 -1 0), since -1 is True, the clause is True.
- In the second clause (-3 -1 -2 0), -1 is True, making the clause True.
- This pattern follows for all the clauses.

Therefore, having variable 1 as True, and variables 2 and 3 as False is indeed a solution to the problem.

Answer: 1 -2 -3
