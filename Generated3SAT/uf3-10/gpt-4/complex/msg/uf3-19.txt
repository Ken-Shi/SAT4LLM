The given problem is in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), which is a conjunction (AND operation) of one or more clauses, where a clause is a disjunction (OR operation) of literals.

The first line of the problem represents the problem type, the number of variables (3), and the number of clauses (10).

Each of the following lines represents a clause. A positive number indicates the presence of the corresponding variable, and a negative number represents the negation of the corresponding variable. For example, "-1 3 2 0" can be translated as "NOT variable 1 OR variable 3 OR variable 2".

This problem can be solved by using a technique called the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. The algorithm applies a set of rules that reduce the problem until a solution is determined.

1. If there is a clause with a single literal, that literal must be true. There is no such clause in our case.
2. If a variable appears with one polarity in all clauses where it appears, it should be assigned the value making all these clauses true. There is no such variable in our case.
3. If the previous rules do not apply, the algorithm selects a variable and branches the search into two cases. The variable is both positive and negative.

After applying these principles, we can simplify the SAT problem:

Applying DPLL:

1. No single literal clause.
2. No variable with a single polarity
3. Variable branching, we can choose any variable here, let's choose 1:
   - Case 1: 1 is True. Assign all clauses with 1 to True. This results in the new problem:
      2 -3 0
      -2 -3 0
      2 -3 0
      2 0
      This is satisfiable with 2=True and 3=False.
    - Case 2: 1 is False. Assign all clauses with -1 to True. This results in the new problem:
      2 -3 0
      2 -3 0
      -3 0
      2 -3 0
      -3 0
      2 0
      This is not satisfiable as there is a -3 in clause on its own, which implies 3 is always false and there is a clause where 3 is required to be true.

The SAT problem is satisfiable when variable 1 is True, variable 2 is True, and 3 is False.

Answer: {1=True, 2=True, 3=False}
