To start, let's break down what the DIMACS format represents.

In the first line ("p cnf 3 10"), "p" represents the problem line which describes the problem type and its parameters. "cnf" tells us the problem is a satisfiability problem in conjunctive normal form. "3" is the number of variables and "10" is the number of clauses.

The following lines represent our clauses. In each of these lines, "0" represents the end of a clause and the numbers before it are the literals. Negative numbers represent the NOT-version of a variable (e.g. "-3" is "NOT 3").

To solve this, we are looking for an assignment of the variables (1, 2, and 3) such that all clauses in the formula are true. If we cannot find such an assignment, then the formula is unsatisfiable.

Let's assign true to 1, true to 2 and false to 3:

- "-3 1 2 0" => NOT false OR true OR true = true
- "-2 1 -3 0" => NOT true OR true OR false = true
- "-2 1 -3 0" => NOT true OR true OR false = true
- "-3 1 -2 0" => NOT false OR true OR true = true
- "2 -3 1 0" => true OR false OR true = true
- "-1 3 -2 0" => NOT true OR false OR true = true
- "2 1 -3 0" => true OR true OR false = true
- "1 -2 -3 0" => true OR NOT true OR false = true
- "1 -3 -2 0" => true OR NOT false OR NOT true = true
- "-2 -3 1 0" => NOT true OR NOT false OR true = true

So, all clauses are true when 1 and 2 are true and 3 is false, which means that this formula is satisfiable.

Answer:
(1=true, 2=true, 3=false)
