This problem represents a Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) formula, which is a conjunction of one or more clauses, where a clause is a disjunction of literals. 

The DIMACS format is fairly simple:
- The first line states that our problem has 3 variables (named 1, 2, 3) and 10 clauses 
- Each subsequent line is a clause made up of literals until it hits 0

To solve this problem we may use a method called the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. Unfortunately, this problem has no solution. This is because all clauses are disjunctive, and in each one there is a variable that appears negated and a variable that does not appear negated. If a variable X appears negated in one clause and does not appear negated in another clause, then there is no assignment of values that could make both clauses true. For instance, a solution could be X='true' but that would make the first clause false, or X='false', but that would make a second clause false.

Furthermore, if you analyze the clauses, you will find that both alternatives for every variable (true and false) will make some clause false. As example if 1 is true, clause (-3 -2 -1 0) will be false, and if 1 is false, clause (-2 -3 1 0) will be false. Same logic applies to variables 2 and 3. Thus, this formula is unsatisfiable. 

Answer: No solution.
