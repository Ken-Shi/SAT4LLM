The SAT problem in DIMACS format is a conjunctive normal form (CNF) representation of a boolean formula. The provided problem has three variables (represented by the integer 1, 2 and 3) and ten clauses. Before proceeding to solve this, let's break down the structure of the DIMACS encoding in simple words:

- "p cnf 3 10" denotes that the SAT problem is using three variables and there are ten clauses.
- Each subsequent line is a clause where each member separated by a space is a literal. 
- The literal can be a variable or its negation (-).
- Each clause is ended by '0'.

To solve this SAT Problem:

The strategy is to start by assigning values to variables arbitrarily and then verifying if the all the clauses can be satisfied simultaneously. If not, we change the assignments until all clauses are satisfied, or we confirm it's unsolvable. 

Let's start by assigning the following values: 1=True, 2=True, 3=True. 

With these values, the table becomes: 

- 2 -1 -3 0 > T F F > Not Satisfied
- 2 -3 -1 0 > T F F > Not Satisfied 
- -2 -1 -3 0 > F F F > Satisfied
- -3 -1 2 0 > F F T > Satisfied
- 2 -3 -1 0 > T F F > Not Satisfied 
- -2 1 -3 0 > F T F > Not Satisfied 
- -1 2 3 0 > F T T > Satisfied
- 2 -1 -3 0 > T F F > Not Satisfied
- 2 3 -1 0 > T T F > Satisfied
- 1 -3 2 0 > T F T > Satisfied

Notice that several clauses are not satisfied (marked with 'Not Satisfied'), so these values of the variables do not solve the SAT problem.

Let's try again by making 3=False (i.e., assigning -3 =True)

With the values 1=True, 2=True, 3=False, we get a satisfying solution as all clauses are TRUE now:

- 2 -1 -3 0 > T F T > Satisfied
- 2 -3 -1 0 > T T F > Satisfied 
- -2 -1 -3 0 > F F T > Satisfied
- -3 -1 2 0 > T F T > Satisfied
- 2 -3 -1 0 > T T F > Satisfied 
- -2 1 -3 0 > F T T > Satisfied 
- -1 2 3 0 > F T F > Satisfied
- 2 -1 -3 0 > T F T > Satisfied
- 2 3 -1 0 > T F F > Satisfied
- 1 -3 2 0 > T T T > Satisfied

So, we have found a solution for this SAT problem.

Answer: Assign 1=True, 2=True, 3=False. Which can be written as 1, 2, -3.
