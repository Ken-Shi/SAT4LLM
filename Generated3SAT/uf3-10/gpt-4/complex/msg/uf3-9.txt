This SAT problem is in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) which is a conjunction (AND operation) of one or more clauses, where a clause is a disjunction (OR operation) of literals. 

The first line "p cnf 3 10" refers to the problem definition:
- ''p'' refers to problem, 'cnf' indicates Conjunct Normal Form.
- '3' is the number of variables being used, and '10' is the number of clauses in the problem.

Here's a line-by-line analysis of this SAT problem after the header:

1.  1 -2 -3 0 : This clause is saying that variable 1 is true, or variable 2 is false, or variable 3 is false.
2. -3 -2 -1 0 : This clause says that variable 1 is false, variable 2 is false, or variable 3 is false.
3.  1 -2 -3 0 : This is the same as the first clause.
4.  1 -2 -3 0 : Again, same as first clause.
5.  1 3 -2 0  : This one says variable 1 is true, variable 2 is false, or variable 3 is true.
6.  2 -3 1 0  : This says that variable 1 is true, variable 2 is true, or variable 3 is false.
7. -2 1 -3 0  : This one says that variable 1 is true, variable 2 is false, or variable 3 is false.
8.  1 -3 2 0  : This clause says that variable 1 is true, variable 2 is true, or variable 3 is false.
9. -1 -3 -2 0 : This says that variable 1 is false, variable 2 is false, or variable 3 is false.
10. 1 -2 -3 0 : This is the same as the first clause.

In each clause, if one of the literals is true, then that clause is satisfied. We need to find an assignment of the variables which satisfies all the clauses if possible.

From analysing the clauses, it is noticed that:
- The first variable has to be true because it is in four clauses as the only positive literal, including the ones with all negative literals.
- The second variable is negative in most clauses with positive literals. Therefore, setting it to 'false' satisfies more clauses than setting it to 'true'.
- The third variable is mainly negative in the clauses which contain a positive literal. Therefore, setting it to 'false' satisfies a greater number of clauses.

Therefore, an assignment that could satisfy all the clauses is: 1=true, 2=false, and 3=false.

Answer: 1=true, 2=false, 3=false.
