This problem is in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and it represents Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT).

Let's denote literals 1, 2, 3 as x, y, and z, respectively.

Each line represents a clause in a CNF:

3 -2 -1 0 --> (z OR NOT y OR NOT x)
2 -1 3 0  -> (y OR NOT x OR z)
-3 2 -1 0 -> (NOT z OR y OR NOT x)
3 2 1 0  -> (z OR y OR x)
3 -1 -2 0 -> (z OR NOT x OR NOT y)
3 2 -1 0 -> (z OR y OR NOT x)
2 3 -1 0 -> (y OR z OR NOT x)
3 2 -1 0 -> (z OR y OR NOT x)
3 1 2 0 -> (z OR x OR y)
2 3 -1 0 -> (y OR z OR NOT x)

Each clause is a disjunction of literals and the whole formula is a conjunction of those clauses. Now, we need to find a satisfying assignment to the literals (i.e. x, y, z) that makes the whole formula true.

We can choose:
x = False
y = True
z = True

This will satisfy all clauses, and hence, the entire formula.

Therefore,

Answer:
x = False
y = True
z = True

In DIMAC format, positive integers denote the literal while negative integers denote the negation of the literal (for example, 1 is x and -1 is NOT x). Therefore, in the answer using the DIMAC notation, we can say:
-1 2 3

This represents the solution x = False (i.e., -1, since NOT x is true), y = True (i.e., 2, since y is true), and z = True (i.e., 3, since z is true).
