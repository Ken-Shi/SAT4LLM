                "content": "This problem is in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and it represents Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT).\n\nLet's denote literals 1, 2, 3 as x, y, and z, respectively.\n\nEach line represents a clause in a CNF:\n\n3 -2 -1 0 --> (z OR NOT y OR NOT x)\n2 -1 3 0  -> (y OR NOT x OR z)\n-3 2 -1 0 -> (NOT z OR y OR NOT x)\n3 2 1 0  -> (z OR y OR x)\n3 -1 -2 0 -> (z OR NOT x OR NOT y)\n3 2 -1 0 -> (z OR y OR NOT x)\n2 3 -1 0 -> (y OR z OR NOT x)\n3 2 -1 0 -> (z OR y OR NOT x)\n3 1 2 0 -> (z OR x OR y)\n2 3 -1 0 -> (y OR z OR NOT x)\n\nEach clause is a disjunction of literals and the whole formula is a conjunction of those clauses. Now, we need to find a satisfying assignment to the literals (i.e. x, y, z) that makes the whole formula true.\n\nWe can choose:\nx = False\ny = True\nz = True\n\nThis will satisfy all clauses, and hence, the entire formula.\n\nTherefore,\n\nAnswer:\nx = False\ny = True\nz = True\n\nIn DIMAC format, positive integers denote the literal while negative integers denote the negation of the literal (for example, 1 is x and -1 is NOT x). Therefore, in the answer using the DIMAC notation, we can say:\n-1 2 3\n\nThis represents the solution x = False (i.e., -1, since NOT x is true), y = True (i.e., 2, since y is true), and z = True (i.e., 3, since z is true)."
