                "content": "This kind of problem is usually solved by the SAT solver algorithm such as DPLL(Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland). Let's try to directly apply this algorithm to our problem and see if we can find the solution.\n\nWe can view the problem as a set of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction (OR operation) of literals, and the whole problem is a conjunction (AND operation) of these clauses. A literal is either a variable or its negation. In our case, we have 3 variables: 1, 2, 3. A positive number stands for the variable itself and a negative number stands for the negation of the variable.\n\nInitially, we don't have any values for our variables. Let's start from the first one - 1.\n\nAssign 1 = TRUE. Substitute this value into all the clauses. If a clause contains 1, it becomes TRUE and can be removed. If a clause contains -1, -1 becomes FALSE, it can be removed from the clause. \n\n-3 2 -1 0\n-3 2 0\n\nThen let's look at variable 2.\n\nIf 2 = TRUE, \n\n-3 2 -1 0\n-3 0\n \nThe clause -3 0 is unsatisfiable because -3 (or 3 = FALSE) is always FALSE. Hence, 2 cannot be TRUE, so 2 = FALSE. \n\nSubstitute 2 = FALSE into all remaining clauses. \n\n-3 -2 1 0\n-3 1 0 \n\nFinally, let's look at variable 3. \n\nBecause we only have one remaining clause -3 1 0, which is equivalent to 3 = FALSE or 1 = TRUE. We know 1 = TRUE already, so this clause does not impose any new restrictions on 3. Therefore, 3 can be freely chosen as TRUE or FALSE.\n\nTherefore, we have found one satisfying assignments: \n- 1 = TRUE \n- 2 = FALSE\n- 3 = TRUE or FALSE\n\nWe could encode them as positive for TRUE and negative for FALSE. Hence, the solution in DIMACS format would be \n\nAnswer:\n\n1 -2 3 0\n1 -2 -3 0"
