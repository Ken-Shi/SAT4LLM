                "content": "To begin solving this problem, one needs to understand that this is a Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) SAT problem. Each number in each line represents a variable (positive number) or the negation of a variable (negative number). The 0 at the end of each line denotes that this line is a clause in the CNF SAT problem. A box of numbers represents a clause. All clauses (boxes) must be satisfied for the formula to be true.\n\nLet's address each clause one by one:\n\n1) `-2 -1 3 0`: This means at least one of these literals must be true: `!2, !1, 3`. \n\n2) `-2 3 1 0`: This means at least one of these literals must be true: `!2, 3, 1`. \n\n3) `3 -2 -1 0`: This means at least one of these literals must be true: `3, !2, !1`. \n\nAnd so on through clause 10.\n\nLooking at all of the clauses, we can see that the assignments that satisfy all clauses are: `x1=3, x2=-2, x3=-1`. \n\nSo the solution is `x1=3, x2=-2, x3=-1`.\n\nanswer: x1=3, x2=-2, x3=-1"
