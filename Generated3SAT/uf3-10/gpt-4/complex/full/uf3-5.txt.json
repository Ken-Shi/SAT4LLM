                "content": "The problem states that there are 3 variables, and there are 10 clauses. The variables can only take the value of either true or false, represented as 1 or -1 respectively. Each line that follows is a clause consisting of variables or their negations and ends on 0. The clause is satisfied if at least one of the literals in it is true.\n\nLet's denote the three variables as a, b and c. Here, 1, 2, 3 refer to a, b and c while -1, -2, -3 refer to not a (\u00aca), not b (\u00acb) and not c (\u00acc) respectively. So, the problem translates to:\n\n(-c -b a) - clause1\n(a -b -c) - clause2\n(a -c -b) - clause3\n(-b -c -a) - clause4\n(a -c -b) - clause5\n(-c -a b) - clause6\n(a -c -b) - clause7\n(b a c) - clause8\n(-a b -c) - clause9\n(-a -b -c) - clause10\n\nFrom clauses 3,5,7 we get that at least one from a, b and c is true. From clauses 4,10, both should be false. Thus a or b or c is true and a, b, c are not all true at the same time. That means exactly one of a, b, c is true. Let's try setting a = true, b = false, c = false. It checks out with all the clauses, so it is a solution.\n\nThe original DIMACS format had the variables as 1,2,3. So according to our above solution, 1 (or 'a') is true, and 2 (or 'b') and 3 (or 'c') are false.\n\nanswer: 1 -2 -3"
