We could make 1 true, and since there's no conflict with other lines (I checked ahead and didn't see any obvious conflicts with setting 1 to true), I'll keep it.\n\nThe second line, 3 1 2 0, is already true, since 1 is true. \n\nThe third line, -2 3 1 0, we have 1 as true, so this is already satisfied.\n\nThe fourth line, -3 1 2 0, again is already satisfied, since 1 is true. \n\nThe fifth line, 1 2 3 0, we can set 2 and 3 to true, because it doesn't conflict with any other lines. \n\nThe other lines also hold the solution true.\n\nSo, the solution to our problem is: \n\nanswer: 1=true, 2=true, 3=true."
