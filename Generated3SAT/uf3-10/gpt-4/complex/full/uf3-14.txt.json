                "content": "Each line in this DIMACS format SAT (Propositional Satisfiability) problem represents a clause of a Boolean expression, which consists of three variables: 1, 2, and 3. The 'p cnf 3 10' line specifies that this is a 3-variable problem with 10 clauses. The numbers in each line represent literals - a positive number indicates the variable, negative shows its negation. '0' at the end of a line signals the end of a clause.\n\nFirstly, let's try to write out each clause:\n\n(3 OR 2 OR NOT 1)\n(NOT 1 OR 3 OR 2)\n(NOT 1 OR 3 OR 2)\n(NOT 1 OR 2 OR NOT 3)\n(2 OR 1 OR 3)\n(NOT 1 OR 2 OR NOT 3)\n(3 OR 1 OR 2)\n(NOT 1 OR 3 OR 2)\n(NOT 1 OR 3 OR 2)\n(NOT 1 OR NOT 2 OR NOT 3)\n\nTo find a solution, we try to assign the values (TRUE or FALSE) to the variables (1, 2 and 3) in a way to satisfy all clauses.\n\nIt is clear that assigning 1 to FALSE would simplify things, as it occurs as a NOT 1 in most clauses. \n\nAfter setting 1 = FALSE, the clauses become: \n\n(3 OR 2)\n(3 OR 2)\n(2 OR NOT 3)\n(2 OR 3)\n(2 OR 3)\n(3 OR 2)\n(3 OR 2)\n(NOT 2 OR NOT 3)\n\nNow, if we assign 2 and 3 = TRUE, all clauses are satisfied because each clause obtains at least one TRUE literal. \n\nanswer: {1=FALSE, 2=TRUE, 3=TRUE}"
