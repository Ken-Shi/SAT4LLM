Starting with all variables set to false, we can try all possible combinations and check if they satisfy all clauses.\n\nLet's start with the first combination:\n- Variable 1 = false\n- Variable 2 = false\n- Variable 3 = false\n\nChecking each clause, we see that this combination does not satisfy clause 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. So, this combination is not a solution.\n\nNext combination:\n- Variable 1 = true\n- Variable 2 = false\n- Variable 3 = false\n\nChecking the clauses, we see that this combination does not satisfy clause 2, 3, and 4. So, this combination is also not a solution.\n\nWe continue this process until we find a satisfying assignment.\n\nAfter checking all possible combinations, we find that the following assignment satisfies all clauses:\n- Variable 1 = false\n- Variable 2 = true\n- Variable 3 = false\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nanswer: 0 1 0"
