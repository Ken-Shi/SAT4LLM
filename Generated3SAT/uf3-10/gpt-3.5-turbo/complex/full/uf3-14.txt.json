Identify the number of variables and clauses:\n   Number of variables (n) = 3\n   Number of clauses (m) = 10\n\n2. Interpret the clauses:\n   - Clause 1: (3 OR 2 OR -1)\n   - Clause 2: (-1 OR 3 OR 2)\n   - Clause 3: (-1 OR 3 OR 2)\n   - Clause 4: (-1 OR 2 OR -3)\n   - Clause 5: (2 OR 1 OR 3)\n   - Clause 6: (-1 OR 2 OR -3)\n   - Clause 7: (3 OR 1 OR 2)\n   - Clause 8: (-1 OR 3 OR 2)\n   - Clause 9: (-1 OR 3 OR 2)\n   - Clause 10: (-1 OR -2 OR -3)\n\n3. We will now try to find a satisfying assignment that makes all the clauses true. \n\nLet's analyze the clauses:\n- Clause 1: (3 OR 2 OR -1) True (assign variables 3, 2, -1)\n- Clause 2: (-1 OR 3 OR 2) True (already satisfied by previous assignment)\n- Clause 3: (-1 OR 3 OR 2) True (already satisfied by previous assignment)\n- Clause 4: (-1 OR 2 OR -3) True (assign variables -1, 2, -3)\n- Clause 5: (2 OR 1 OR 3) True (assign variables 2, 1, 3)\n- Clause 6: (-1 OR 2 OR -3) True (already satisfied by previous assignment)\n- Clause 7: (3 OR 1 OR 2) True (already satisfied by previous assignment)\n- Clause 8: (-1 OR 3 OR 2) True (already satisfied by previous assignment)\n- Clause 9: (-1 OR 3 OR 2) True (already satisfied by previous assignment)\n- Clause 10: (-1 OR -2 OR -3) True (assign variables -1, -2, -3)\n\nTherefore, to satisfy all clauses, the following assignment works:\n- Variable 1 = False\n- Variable 2 = True\n- Variable 3 = True\n\nanswer: 2 -3 3"
