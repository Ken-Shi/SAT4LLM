(3, -2, -1)\n2. (2, -1, 3)\n3. (-3, 2, -1)\n4. (3, 2, 1)\n5. (3, -1, -2)\n6. (3, 2, -1)\n7. (2, 3, -1)\n8. (3, 2, -1)\n9. (3, 1, 2)\n10. (2, 3, -1)\n\nWe need to find an assignment of variables that makes all 10 clauses true. \n\nFrom clauses 1, 2, and 4, we can see that variable 2 must be true.\nFrom clauses 3, 7, and 10, we can see that variable 3 must be true.\n\nThus, the satisfying assignment is:\n1. Variable 1 is False\n2. Variable 2 is True\n3. Variable 3 is True\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nanswer: 0 1 -2 3"
