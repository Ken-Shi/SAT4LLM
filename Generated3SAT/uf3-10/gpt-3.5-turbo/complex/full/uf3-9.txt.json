(1 OR -2 OR -3)\n\nNow, we will try to find a satisfying assignment for the given clauses. We will refer to the variables as x1, x2, and x3.\n\n1. (1 OR -2 OR -3): We can assign x1 = 1, x2 = 0, x3 = 0 to satisfy this clause.\n2. (-3 OR -2 OR -1): We can assign x1 = 0, x2 = 0, x3 = 0 to satisfy this clause.\n3. (1 OR -2 OR -3): We can assign x1 = 1, x2 = 0, x3 = 0 to satisfy this clause.\n4. (1 OR -2 OR -3): We can assign x1 = 1, x2 = 0, x3 = 0 to satisfy this clause.\n5. (1 OR 3 OR -2): We can assign x1 = 1, x2 = 0, x3 = 1 to satisfy this clause.\n6. (2 OR -3 OR 1): We can assign x1 = 1, x2 = 1, x3 = 0 to satisfy this clause.\n7.
