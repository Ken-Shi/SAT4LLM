(1 2 -3) - This means either 1 and 2 are true, or 3 is false.\n2. (3 1 2) - This means either 3 is true, or both 1 and 2 are true.\n3. (-2 3 1) - This means either 2 is false, or 3 is true, or 1 is true.\n4. (-3 1 2) - This means either 3 is false, or both 1 and 2 are true.\n5. (1 2 3) - This means either 1 and 2 are true, or 3 is true.\n6. (1 -3 2) - This means either 1 is true, or 3 is false, or 2 is true.\n7. (2 -3 1) - This means either 2 is true, or 3 is false, or 1 is true.\n8. (2 -3 1) - This is a duplicate clause.\n9. (-3 1 2) - This is another duplicate clause.\n10. (2 -1 -3) - This means either 2 is true, or 1 is false, or 3 is false.\n\nNow let's try to satisfy as many clauses as possible:\n- From clause 1, we can set 1 = True, 2 = True, 3 = False.\n- From clause 2, we can keep 3 = False.\n- From clause 3, we can keep 3 = False.\n- From clause 4, we can keep 3 = False.\n- From clause 7, we can keep 2 = True.\n- From clause 10, we can keep 2 = True.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\nanswer: 1 1 -1"
