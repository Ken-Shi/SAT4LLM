(3 -2 1)\n6. (3 1 2)\n7. (-1 3 2)\n8. (3 2 1)\n9. (-1 3 2)\n10. (3 2 -1)\n\nWe need to find a satisfying assignment for these clauses. Let's analyze the clauses:\n\n- Clause 1, 4, 8: All contain all variables 1, 2, and 3. This means one of these clauses must be true.\n\n- Clause 2, 6: Both contain variables 1 and 2. This means one of these clauses must be true.\n\n- Clause 3: Contains variables 1 and 3. This means this clause must be true.\n\n- Clause 5: Contains variables 1 and 2. This means this clause must be true.\n\n- Clause 7, 9: Both contain variables 1 and 3. This means one of these clauses must be true.\n\n- Clause 10: Contains variables 1 and 2. This means this clause must be true.\n\nFrom the analysis above, we can see that for a satisfying assignment:\n1 must be true\n2 must be true\n3 must be true\n\nTherefore, the satisfying assignment for this problem is:\n1 = true\n2 = true\n3 = true\n\nanswer: 1 2 3"
