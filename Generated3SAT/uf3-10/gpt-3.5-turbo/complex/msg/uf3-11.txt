To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to convert the clauses into a more understandable format:

1. (1 OR -2 OR 3)
2. (3 OR -2 OR 1)
3. (1 OR 3 OR -2)
4. (-2 OR 3 OR 1)
5. (3 OR -1 OR 2)
6. (-2 OR 3 OR 1)
7. (3 OR -2 OR -1)
8. (3 OR 1 OR -2)
9. (3 OR -2 OR 1)
10. (-3 OR -2 OR 1)

Now, let's try to find a satisfying assignment:

For clause 1: 1 is true.
For clause 2: 3 is true.
For clause 3: 1 is false, 3 is true, -2 is true.
For clause 4: -2 is true.
For clause 5: 3 is true.
For clause 6: 3 is true.
For clause 7: 3 is true.
For clause 8: 3 is true.
For clause 9: 3 is true.
For clause 10: -3 is true.

Therefore, the satisfying assignment is: 1=true, 2=true, 3=true.

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: 1 1 1
