To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to convert the given clauses into a readable format. The first line "p cnf 3 10" indicates that there are 3 variables and 10 clauses.

The clauses are:
1. -3 -2 1
2. 1 -2 -3
3. 1 -3 -2
4. -2 -3 -1
5. 1 -3 -2
6. -3 -1 2
7. 1 -3 -2
8. 2 1 3
9. -1 2 -3
10. -1 -2 -3

Based on these clauses, we can see that the clauses 1 through 9 have a single solution:
- Variable 1 = True
- Variable 2 = True
- Variable 3 = False

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: 1 1 -3
