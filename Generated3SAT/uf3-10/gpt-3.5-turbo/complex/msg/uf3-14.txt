To solve this SAT problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of variables and clauses:
   Number of variables (n) = 3
   Number of clauses (m) = 10

2. Interpret the clauses:
   - Clause 1: (3 OR 2 OR -1)
   - Clause 2: (-1 OR 3 OR 2)
   - Clause 3: (-1 OR 3 OR 2)
   - Clause 4: (-1 OR 2 OR -3)
   - Clause 5: (2 OR 1 OR 3)
   - Clause 6: (-1 OR 2 OR -3)
   - Clause 7: (3 OR 1 OR 2)
   - Clause 8: (-1 OR 3 OR 2)
   - Clause 9: (-1 OR 3 OR 2)
   - Clause 10: (-1 OR -2 OR -3)

3. We will now try to find a satisfying assignment that makes all the clauses true. 

Let's analyze the clauses:
- Clause 1: (3 OR 2 OR -1) True (assign variables 3, 2, -1)
- Clause 2: (-1 OR 3 OR 2) True (already satisfied by previous assignment)
- Clause 3: (-1 OR 3 OR 2) True (already satisfied by previous assignment)
- Clause 4: (-1 OR 2 OR -3) True (assign variables -1, 2, -3)
- Clause 5: (2 OR 1 OR 3) True (assign variables 2, 1, 3)
- Clause 6: (-1 OR 2 OR -3) True (already satisfied by previous assignment)
- Clause 7: (3 OR 1 OR 2) True (already satisfied by previous assignment)
- Clause 8: (-1 OR 3 OR 2) True (already satisfied by previous assignment)
- Clause 9: (-1 OR 3 OR 2) True (already satisfied by previous assignment)
- Clause 10: (-1 OR -2 OR -3) True (assign variables -1, -2, -3)

Therefore, to satisfy all clauses, the following assignment works:
- Variable 1 = False
- Variable 2 = True
- Variable 3 = True

answer: 2 -3 3
