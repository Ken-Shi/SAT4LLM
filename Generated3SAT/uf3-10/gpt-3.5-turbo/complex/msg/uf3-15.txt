To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to analyze each clause and determine the truth values of the variables that satisfy all clauses.

The DIMACS format is as follows:
p cnf 3 10
2 -3 -1 0
2 -3 -1 0
2 -3 -1 0
2 -1 3 0
2 -1 -3 0
-3 2 -1 0
-3 2 1 0
-1 2 -3 0
-3 2 -1 0
-2 -3 1 0

We have 3 variables (1, 2, and 3) and a total of 10 clauses.

1. The first three clauses are identical: (2 OR -3 OR -1) = TRUE
2. The fourth clause: (2 OR -1 OR 3) = TRUE
3. The fifth clause: (2 OR -1 OR -3) = TRUE
4. The sixth clause: (-3 OR 2 OR -1) = TRUE
5. The seventh clause: (-3 OR 2 OR 1) = TRUE
6. The eighth clause: (-1 OR 2 OR -3) = TRUE
7. The ninth clause: (-3 OR 2 OR -1) = TRUE
8. The tenth clause: (-2 OR -3 OR 1) = TRUE

Therefore, the solution that satisfies all clauses is:
answer: 2, -3, -1
