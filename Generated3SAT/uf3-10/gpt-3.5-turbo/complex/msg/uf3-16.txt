To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can first rewrite the clauses in a more readable format:

1. (3 2 1)
2. (1 3 2)
3. (1 -2 3)
4. (1 3 2)
5. (3 -2 1)
6. (3 1 2)
7. (-1 3 2)
8. (3 2 1)
9. (-1 3 2)
10. (3 2 -1)

We need to find a satisfying assignment for these clauses. Let's analyze the clauses:

- Clause 1, 4, 8: All contain all variables 1, 2, and 3. This means one of these clauses must be true.

- Clause 2, 6: Both contain variables 1 and 2. This means one of these clauses must be true.

- Clause 3: Contains variables 1 and 3. This means this clause must be true.

- Clause 5: Contains variables 1 and 2. This means this clause must be true.

- Clause 7, 9: Both contain variables 1 and 3. This means one of these clauses must be true.

- Clause 10: Contains variables 1 and 2. This means this clause must be true.

From the analysis above, we can see that for a satisfying assignment:
1 must be true
2 must be true
3 must be true

Therefore, the satisfying assignment for this problem is:
1 = true
2 = true
3 = true

answer: 1 2 3
