To solve this SAT problem, we need to analyze the DIMACS format clauses provided:

1. -3 1 2 0: Either not 3 or 1 or 2 must be true.
2. -2 1 -3 0: Either not 2 or 1 or not 3 must be true.
3. -2 1 -3 0: Same as the second clause.
4. -3 1 -2 0: Either not 3 or 1 or not 2 must be true.
5. 2 -3 1 0: Either 2 or not 3 or 1 must be true.
6. -1 3 -2 0: Either not 1 or 3 or not 2 must be true.
7. 2 1 -3 0: Either 2 or 1 or not 3 must be true.
8. 1 -2 -3 0: Either 1 or not 2 or not 3 must be true.
9. 1 -3 -2 0: Either 1 or not 3 or not 2 must be true.
10. -2 -3 1 0: Either not 2 or not 3 or 1 must be true.

By evaluating these clauses, we can deduce that the only solution that satisfies all of them is:
-3 is false
-2 is false
1 is true

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: 010
