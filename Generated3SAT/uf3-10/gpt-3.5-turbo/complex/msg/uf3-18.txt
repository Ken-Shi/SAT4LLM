To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to analyze each clause to determine if there exists a satisfying assignment.

The DIMACS format begins with "p cnf 3 10", which indicates that there are 3 variables and 10 clauses.

Next, we will analyze each clause:
1. 2 -3 -1 0: This clause can be satisfied by assigning variable 2 to True, variable 3 to False, and variable 1 to False.
2. -3 -1 2 0: This clause can be satisfied by assigning variable 3 to False, variable 1 to False, and variable 2 to True.
3. 2 -3 -1 0: This is a repeat of clause 1.
4. 2 -1 -3 0: This can be satisfied by assigning variable 2 to True, variable 1 to False, and variable 3 to False.
5. 2 -3 -1 0: This is a repeat of clause 1.
6. 3 -1 2 0: This can be satisfied by assigning variable 3 to True, variable 1 to False, and variable 2 to True.
7. 2 -1 -3 0: This is a repeat of clause 4.
8. 3 -2 -1 0: This can be satisfied by assigning variable 3 to True, variable 2 to False, and variable 1 to False.
9. 3 1 2 0: This can be satisfied by assigning variable 3 to True, variable 1 to True, and variable 2 to True.
10. -1 2 -3 0: This clause can be satisfied by assigning variable 1 to False, variable 2 to True, and variable 3 to False.

Since we have found a satisfying assignment for all clauses, the answer to this SAT problem is:
answer: 2 -3 -1
