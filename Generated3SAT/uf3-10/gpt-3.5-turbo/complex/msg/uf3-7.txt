To solve this SAT problem, we need to convert the given DIMACS format into a more readable format. 

The CNF formula is:
(-3 or 1 or -2) and (-3 or 2 or 1) and (2 or 1 or -3) and (-2 or -3 or -1) and (2 or 1 or -3) and (-3 or 2 or 1) and (-3 or 2 or 1) and (-3 or 2 or 1) and (2 or -3 or 1) and (1 or -3 or 2)

Now, we can analyze the clause one by one to find the solution:

1. Clause (-3 or 1 or -2):
Since 1 or -2 are both false, -3 must be true.

2. Clause (-3 or 2 or 1):
Since -3 is true, the other literals can be either true or false. 

3. Clause (2 or 1 or -3):
Since 2 and 1 are both true, -3 must be false.

4. Clause (-2 or -3 or -1):
Since -2 is false and -1 is true, -3 must be true.

5. Clause (2 or 1 or -3):
Since 2 is true, and -3 is false, 1 must be true.

6. Clause (-3 or 2 or 1):
Since -3 is already true, this clause doesn't affect the solution.

7. Clause (-3 or 2 or 1):
Since -3 is already true, this clause doesn't affect the solution.

8. Clause (-3 or 2 or 1):
Since -3 is already true, this clause doesn't affect the solution.

9. Clause (2 or -3 or 1):
Since 2 is true, and -3 is false, 1 must be true.

10. Clause (1 or -3 or 2):
Since 1 is already true, this clause doesn't affect the solution.

Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:
-3 = true
2 = true
1 = true

answer: -3, 2, 1
