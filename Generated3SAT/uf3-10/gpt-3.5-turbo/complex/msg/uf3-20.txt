First, let's decode the problem into a more readable format:

- (2, -1, -3)
- (2, -3, -1)
- (-2, -1, -3)
- (-3, -1, 2)
- (2, -3, -1)
- (-2, 1, -3)
- (-1, 2, 3)
- (2, -1, -3)
- (2, 3, -1)
- (1, -3, 2)

Based on the given DIMACS format, we have 3 variables and 10 clauses.

To solve this problem, we can try to find a satisfying assignment using a brute-force approach. Starting with all variables set to false, we can try all possible combinations and check if they satisfy all clauses.

Let's start with the first combination:
- Variable 1 = false
- Variable 2 = false
- Variable 3 = false

Checking each clause, we see that this combination does not satisfy clause 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. So, this combination is not a solution.

Next combination:
- Variable 1 = true
- Variable 2 = false
- Variable 3 = false

Checking the clauses, we see that this combination does not satisfy clause 2, 3, and 4. So, this combination is also not a solution.

We continue this process until we find a satisfying assignment.

After checking all possible combinations, we find that the following assignment satisfies all clauses:
- Variable 1 = false
- Variable 2 = true
- Variable 3 = false

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: 0 1 0
