We have the following SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format:

p cnf 3 10
-3 -2 -1 0
-3 -1 -2 0
-2 -1 3 0
-2 -3 1 0
-3 -1 -2 0
-3 -1 -2 0
-1 -3 -2 0
-3 -1 -2 0
-2 -1 3 0
-2 -3 -1 0

To solve this problem, we can use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment for the variables. Let's try to simplify the problem by analyzing the clauses:

1. -3 -2 -1: Since -1 is present, -3 and -2 must be true to make this clause true.
2. -3 -1 -2: This clause is redundant and can be ignored.
3. -2 -1 3: All variables must be true to satisfy this clause.
4. -2 -3 1: -2 and -3 must be true, while 1 must be false.
5. -1 -3 -2: -1 and -3 must be false, while -2 must be true.
6. -2 -1 3: All variables must be true to satisfy this clause.
7. -2 -3 -1: -2 must be false, while -3 and -1 must be true.

Based on the above analysis, we can see that the clauses have conflicting requirements. This SAT problem is unsatisfiable.

answer: unsatisfiable
