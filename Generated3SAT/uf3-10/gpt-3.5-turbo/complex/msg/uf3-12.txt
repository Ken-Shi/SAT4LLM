To solve this SAT problem, we first need to convert the DIMACS format into a more understandable format. The number after 'p cnf' represents the number of variables (3) and the number of clauses (10). Each clause is represented by a series of numbers ending with 0. For example, the first clause is '-2 -1 3 0'.

Now, let's look at the converted clauses:
1. (-2 v -1 v 3)
2. (-1 v 2 v 3)
3. (2 v -1 v 3)
4. (1 v 2 v 3)
5. (3 v -1 v 2)
6. (3 v 1 v 2)
7. (3 v 2 v -1)
8. (2 v -1 v 3)
9. (3 v -1 v -2)
10. (3 v -1 v 2)

Now, we will try to find a satisfying assignment for these clauses. After examining the clauses, we can see that clause 4 is already satisfied when setting variables to 1, 2, 3. With the other clauses, we can see that setting variable 3 to true satisfies all the clauses. Therefore, the satisfying assignment is 1=true, 2=true, 3=true.

answer: 1=true, 2=true, 3=true
