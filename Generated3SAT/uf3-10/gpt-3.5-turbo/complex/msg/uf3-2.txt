To solve this SAT problem, we can first interpret the DIMACS format given. The first line "p cnf 3 10" indicates that there are 3 variables and 10 clauses in the problem. Each line after that represents a clause in conjunctive normal form (CNF). 

We can represent the problem in a more readable format:
(2 OR 3 OR -1)
(-3 OR -1 OR -2)
(-2 OR 3 OR -1)
(-1 OR -2 OR -3)
(2 OR 3 OR -1)
(-1 OR -2 OR 3)
(3 OR -1 OR -2)
(-1 OR 3 OR 2)
(-2 OR -1 OR 3)
(-3 OR -2 OR -1)

Now, let's try to find a solution by assigning truth values to the variables in a way that satisfies all the clauses. 

Starting with the first clause, we can see that -1 must be true because it appears negated in all the remaining clauses. Let's set x1 = -1. 

Next, looking at the third clause, we see that -2 must be true as it appears negated in all the remaining clauses. Let's set x2 = -2.

Finally, looking at the second clause, we see that -3 must be true as it appears negated in the remaining clauses. Let's set x3 = -3.

Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:
answer: -1 -2 -3
