To solve this SAT problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Convert the given SAT problem in DIMACS format into a more readable form:
   - (2, -1, 3)
   - (3, 2, 1)
   - (1, 2, -3)
   - (3, -1, 2)
   - (2, 1, 3)
   - (3, -2, 1)
   - (3, 2, 1)
   - (1, 3, 2)
   - (2, -3, 1)
   - (-2, 1, -3)

2. Make assignments based on the clauses:
   - Assign 2, 1, 3 to make (2, -1, 3) true
   - Assign 3, 2, 1 to make (3, 2, 1) true
   - Assign 1, 2, -3 to make (1, 2, -3) true
   - Assign 3, -1, 2 to make (3, -1, 2) true
   - Assign 2, 1, 3 to make (2, 1, 3) true
   - Assign 3, -2, 1 to make (3, -2, 1) true
   - Assign 3, 2, 1 to make (3, 2, 1) true
   - Assign 1, 3, 2 to make (1, 3, 2) true
   - Assign 2, -3, 1 to make (2, -3, 1) true
   - Assign -2, 1, -3 to make (-2, 1, -3) true

3. Combining the assignments:
   - 2, 1, 3, -1, -2, -3

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: 2, 1, 3, -1, -2, -3
