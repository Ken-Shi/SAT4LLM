First, we can rewrite the problem in a clearer format:

(-2 ? -1 ? 3)
(-2 ? 3 ? 1)
(3 ? -2 ? -1)
(-2 ? -1 ? 3)
(-2 ? -3 ? 1)
(-2 ? 3 ? -1)
(-2 ? 3 ? -1)
(-3 ? -2 ? -1)
(-1 ? 3 ? -2)
(-3 ? -2 ? -1)

To solve this problem, we can start by assigning values to variables to satisfy the clauses. We can see that clause 9 can be satisfied by assigning 3 to be true. Next, clause 3 can be satisfied by assigning -2 to be true. Then, clause 1 can be satisfied by assigning 1 to be true. 

So, the final assignment that satisfies all clauses is:
-1 is true
-2 is true
-3 is true

answer: -1 -2 -3
