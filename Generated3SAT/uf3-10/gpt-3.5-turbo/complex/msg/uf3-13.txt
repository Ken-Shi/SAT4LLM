To solve this SAT problem in DIMACS format, we will use the following clauses:
1. (-2 v 1 v -3)
2. (-3 v 1 v -2)
3. (-2 v 3 v -1)
4. (-3 v 2 v 1)
5. (-2 v -3 v 1)
6. (-2 v 1 v -3)
7. (-3 v -2 v 1)
8. (-3 v -2 v 1)
9. (-2 v 1 v -3)
10. (3 v 1 v -2)

We can directly see that clauses 1, 2, 6, 9 and 10 have repeated combinations of variables and can be simplified.

Simplifying the clauses:
1. (-2 v 1 v -3)
2. (-3 v 2 v 1)
3. (-2 v 3 v -1)
4. (3 v 1 v -2)

Now, we can see that clauses 1, 3, and 4 form a cycle, which means there is no valid assignment of the variables to satisfy all the clauses.

Therefore, the final answer is:

answer: No solution
