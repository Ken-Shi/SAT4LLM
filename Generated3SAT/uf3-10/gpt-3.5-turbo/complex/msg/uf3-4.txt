To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we want to find a satisfying assignment to the variables that makes all the clauses true.

The DIMACS format given is:
p cnf 3 10
3 -2 -1 0
2 -1 3 0
-3 2 -1 0
3 2 1 0
3 -1 -2 0
3 2 -1 0
2 3 -1 0
3 2 -1 0
3 1 2 0
2 3 -1 0

We can see that there are 3 variables and 10 clauses.

Breaking down the clauses:
1. (3, -2, -1)
2. (2, -1, 3)
3. (-3, 2, -1)
4. (3, 2, 1)
5. (3, -1, -2)
6. (3, 2, -1)
7. (2, 3, -1)
8. (3, 2, -1)
9. (3, 1, 2)
10. (2, 3, -1)

We need to find an assignment of variables that makes all 10 clauses true. 

From clauses 1, 2, and 4, we can see that variable 2 must be true.
From clauses 3, 7, and 10, we can see that variable 3 must be true.

Thus, the satisfying assignment is:
1. Variable 1 is False
2. Variable 2 is True
3. Variable 3 is True

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: 0 1 -2 3
