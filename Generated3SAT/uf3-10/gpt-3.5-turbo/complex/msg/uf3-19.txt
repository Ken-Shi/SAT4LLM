To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will convert the CNF statement into a more readable form:

(x1 OR x3 OR x2)
(x2 OR NOT x3 OR NOT x1)
(NOT x1 OR NOT x3 OR x2)
(x2 OR NOT x3 OR NOT x1)
(NOT x3 OR x1 OR x2)
(NOT x2 OR NOT x3 OR NOT x1)
(x2 OR NOT x1 OR NOT x3)
(NOT x3 OR NOT x1 OR x2)
(NOT x1 OR NOT x3 OR x2)
(x2 OR NOT x3 OR x1)

In this boolean formula, we have 3 variables: x1, x2, and x3. We are trying to find a combination of true/false values for these variables that satisfy all of the clauses.

Now, we can simplify this expression by using logic rules. After simplification, we get:

(x2 OR NOT x1)
(NOT x1 OR x2)

This expression simplifies further to:

x2

Therefore, the only solution to this SAT problem is:

answer: x2=true, x1=false, x3=irrelevant
