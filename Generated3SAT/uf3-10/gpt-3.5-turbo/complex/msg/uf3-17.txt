First, let's interpret the DIMACS format:
- The first line "p cnf 3 10" tells us that there are 3 variables and 10 clauses.
- The clauses are listed after the first line.

Now we can try to solve this problem by looking at the clauses:
1. (1 2 -3) - This means either 1 and 2 are true, or 3 is false.
2. (3 1 2) - This means either 3 is true, or both 1 and 2 are true.
3. (-2 3 1) - This means either 2 is false, or 3 is true, or 1 is true.
4. (-3 1 2) - This means either 3 is false, or both 1 and 2 are true.
5. (1 2 3) - This means either 1 and 2 are true, or 3 is true.
6. (1 -3 2) - This means either 1 is true, or 3 is false, or 2 is true.
7. (2 -3 1) - This means either 2 is true, or 3 is false, or 1 is true.
8. (2 -3 1) - This is a duplicate clause.
9. (-3 1 2) - This is another duplicate clause.
10. (2 -1 -3) - This means either 2 is true, or 1 is false, or 3 is false.

Now let's try to satisfy as many clauses as possible:
- From clause 1, we can set 1 = True, 2 = True, 3 = False.
- From clause 2, we can keep 3 = False.
- From clause 3, we can keep 3 = False.
- From clause 4, we can keep 3 = False.
- From clause 7, we can keep 2 = True.
- From clause 10, we can keep 2 = True.

Therefore, the solution is:
answer: 1 1 -1
