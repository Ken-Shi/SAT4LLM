To solve the given SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use a SAT solver. However, we can also manually analyze the clauses provided to determine if there is a satisfying assignment.

The DIMACS format encodes a SAT problem with 3 variables and 10 clauses. The variables are represented as 1, 2, and 3.

Now, let's analyze the clauses:
1. -2 -3 1 : This clause requires either variable 1 to be true or both variables 2 and 3 to be false.
2. -2 -3 1 : Same as clause 1.
3. -3 2 1 : This clause requires variable 1 to be true if variable 2 is true.
4. -3 -2 1 : Same as clause 3.
5. -3 1 -2 : This clause requires variable 1 to be true if variable 3 is true.
6. -2 3 1 : This clause requires variable 1 to be true if variable 2 is true.
7. 1 2 -3 : This clause requires either variable 1 and 2 to be true or variable 3 to be false.
8. -2 1 -3 : This clause requires variable 1 to be true if variable 2 is false.
9. 2 1 -3 : This clause requires variable 2 to be true if variable 1 is true.
10. -3 2 -1 : This clause requires either variable 2 and 1 to be true or variable 3 to be false.

Based on the analysis of the clauses, it is clear that there is no satisfying assignment that can make all clauses true. Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is UNSATISFIABLE.

answer: UNSATISFIABLE
