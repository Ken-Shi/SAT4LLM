On line 2: '4' or '~5' or '3' must be true, and so on.\n\nWe will run DPLL Algorithm on the input :       \n\nChoosing the most frequent variable '4':    \n- On asserting 4=True, 12th clause gets false since it has -5. So we backtrack and Try 4=False. \n- Backtracking, on asserting 4=False, we find a solution that satisfy all the clauses which is setting: 1=True, 2=False, 3=False, 4=False, 5=False.\n\nThere are other more efficient algorithms like 'Conflict-Driven Clause Learning' where one would start with a random assignment and then iteratively flip the variables that are present in the unsatisfied clauses. The learning part involves analyzing the conflicts (unsatisfied clauses) and adding new clauses to the formula that prevent the same conflict from happening again.\n\nAnswer: 1=True, 2=False, 3=False, 4=False, 5=False."
