This problem is a CNF-SAT problem with 5 variables and 32 clauses. We intend to find a valid assignment to the variables such that each clause is satisfied.

CNF-SAT is an NP-Complete problem, but 5 variables and 32 clauses is a very small problem size, so we can use an exhaustive trial of all 2^5 = 32 possible assignments.

To solve this increase/decrease one variable at a time and for some positive number(n), if a negative counterpart(-n) also exists, take the number with smaller absolute value. Then for each variable go through all clauses to check if the clause will still be satisfied. 

As an example, starting with variable '5', this appears as '-5' and '5'. First we try setting it to true and check all clauses that contain '5' or '-5'. If there's any clause only contains '-5' for instance '2 3 -5 0', this clause will be false since both '2' and '3' have not been set yet, but '-5' would be false. Therefore, we try '5' being false, if all clauses contain '5' or '-5' are satisfied, we can set '5' as false and move on to next variable '4'. Repeat this method until we go through all variables.

Keep in mind that this method may not lead to the most optimal solution but should suffice in many cases. 

Let's try this: 
For variable 5, we see that the clauses containing 5 in positive form are more than those with -5. Hence, we assign the variable 5 'True' value keeping a precedent for the majority. 

Now, let's move to variable 4. We see that variable 4 also appears more in positive form than in negative form. Here, we make a point to check the clauses containing 4. Upon checking we notice that all positive 4 are included in clauses such that the clause will still be satisfied when 4 is set ?True?. Hence, we set variable 4 as 'True'. 

Then take variable 3, and assign ?True? because all clauses containing 3 in positive form or -3 in negative form can be satisfied. 

For variable 2, clause '-3 4 2 0', if we set 2 as true will be False because -3 is False and 4 is True. Try setting 2 as false, all clauses containing 2 or -2 can be satisfied, therefore, set 2 as false.

Finally, for variable 1, all clauses containing -1 and 1 can be satisfied when 1 is set as True.

So our assignment is:

answer: 1=True, 2=False, 3=True, 4=True, 5=True
