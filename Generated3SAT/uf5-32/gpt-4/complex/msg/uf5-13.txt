This is an instance of the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT problem), consisting of clauses in a conjunction. Each clause is a disjunction of literals (variables or their negation). The format used here, DIMACS format, usually represents SAT problems in conjunctive normal form (CNF). The problem here consists of 5 variables and 32 clauses.

To solve this problem, we can use the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm, which applies the resolution rule and the propagation rule recursively. The resolution rule corresponds to the logical inferences we can do following the "or","and", and "not" behavior. The propagation rule corresponds to simplifications of the formula: if a clause indicates "true" or "-false", the clause can be removed, and if a clause indicates "false" or "-true", the clause can be removed and its variable can be assigned the right value.

Here is the steps of DPLL algorithm:
1. Apply unification rule. Because the problem is already given in CNF format, we can skip this step.
2. Apply the resolution rule and the propagation rule recursively until no more resolvable clauses remain: 
  - Look for a unit clause (a clause with one literal). If the literal is positive, assign "true" to its corresponding variable. If the literal is negative, assign "false" to its corresponding variable. 
  - Look for subsumption. If there is a literal that appears always with the same sign in all clauses, assign to it the value that satisfies all the clauses. 
3. If there are unassigned variables that appear in resolvable clauses, arbitrarily assign a value to these variables. 
4. If no contradictions arise from these assignments, the problem is satisfiable under these conditions.

First, we look for a unit clause that exists. Here we do not have such. Then, check subsumption for the variables. Here it also doesn't exists. Now, lets assume some arbirary values, let's take 1 as true, 2 as true, 3 as false, 4 as false and 5 as true. This does not satisfies all clauses. Here, clause 2 is not satisfied. Hence, changing 1 to false and keeping rest same, gives us a valid answer that satisfies all clauses.


Answer: 1=False, 2=True, 3=False, 4=False, 5=True.
