The given problem is a Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT problem) in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) in DIMACS format. This problem involves deciding if there is an interpretation that satisfies a given Boolean formula. The goal is to assign boolean values to each variable so that the whole formula becomes true.

1. We start with the first clause. Since each clause is connected by an OR operator, any literal in a clause being true will make the clause and necessarily the entire CNF expression true. Hence, we can consider that 4= true, 5= true, and 1= true.

2. Next, we move to the second clause. As per this clause, either 2= true OR -5= false OR 4= true. Since 4 is already true and we know that it is a valid assignment, because if 4 was false it would have invalidated the first clause, it asserts that the solution is holding so far.

3. We continue this process to each clause. Since clause 3, 4, and 5 are satisfied by current assignments, we proceed to clause 6.

4. The seventh clause "-3 -2 4 0" implies neither 3 nor 2 can be true. But 2 is already assigned to true. Hence, the assignment is invalid.

5. As there seems to be a contradiction with the seventh clause, we backtrack the assignments and repeat the process.

6. After backtracking and re-assigning, we get 4= true, 5= true, 1= true, 2= false and 3= True. 

7. Iterating this to all clauses, we can see all the clauses satisfy. If there will be contradiction, we will make more backtracks as needed.

Answer: The solution to the given problem is: 
1= true, 2= false, 3= true, 4= true, 5= true.
