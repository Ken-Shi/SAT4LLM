To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use a SAT solver such as MiniSat. However, let's first analyze the problem and convert it into a more readable format.

The problem consists of 5 variables and 32 clauses. Each line represents a disjunction of literals, with a '0' indicating the end of the clause. The literals with a '-' sign represent negation.

We can interpret the DIMACS format as follows:
- Variable 1 is represented by '1'
- Variable 2 is represented by '2'
- Variable 3 is represented by '3'
- Variable 4 is represented by '4'
- Variable 5 is represented by '5'

Now, we can convert the clauses into a more readable format:
1. (-3 v -5 v -4)
2. (-2 v -1 v -5)
3. (1 v -4 v -2)
4. (-5 v 2 v -4)
5. (-5 v 2 v 1)
6. (-2 v 1 v -5)
7. (-2 v 3 v 1)
8. (-3 v -5 v 1)
9. (4 v -2 v -5)
10. (-5 v -1 v -4)
11. (-4 v -5 v -3)
12. (1 v -3 v -5)
13. (3 v 5 v -2)
14. (-4 v -3 v 1)
15. (1 v -3 v -4)
16. (-4 v -3 v -2)
17. (-3 v -2 v 4)
18. (5 v 1 v -2)
19. (-5 v -3 v -2)
20. (-2 v -5 v -3)
21. (-3 v -5 v 4)
22. (-3 v -2 v 1)
23. (1 v 5 v -3)
24. (-2 v 3 v -4)
25. (-5 v 1 v -4)
26. (-1 v -4 v -3)
27. (-5 v 1 v -2)
28. (-2 v 5 v -4)
29. (5 v -2 v -3)
30. (-2 v 1 v 4)
31. (5 v -3 v 4)

Now, we can try using a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment for this problem.

answer: Solution is UNSAT.
