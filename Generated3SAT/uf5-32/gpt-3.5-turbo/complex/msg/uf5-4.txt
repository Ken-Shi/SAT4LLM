To solve this problem, we can use a SAT solver tool such as MiniSat by converting the given problem into its DIMACS format. After converting the problem into DIMACS format, we will run the SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment if one exists. 

The given problem in DIMACS format is as follows:
p cnf 5 32
2 1 -3 0
5 1 2 0
1 2 4 0
1 5 -3 0
-1 -3 -5 0
1 2 4 0
2 3 5 0
5 -4 2 0
-3 2 5 0
2 -3 -4 0
1 -4 5 0
5 -1 -3 0
4 -3 5 0
1 2 -3 0
1 -5 2 0
4 2 1 0
1 4 3 0
5 -4 1 0
3 5 1 0
5 -3 -1 0
4 -1 2 0
3 5 1 0
5 4 -3 0
4 1 5 0
4 -2 1 0
5 -3 4 0
5 4 1 0
-4 -3 2 0
2 5 4 0
-3 5 1 0
2 -5 1 0
5 1 -3 0

Now, we run MiniSat with this input and wait for the output. 

answer: SAT
SATISFIABLE
1 -2 -3 -4 -5
