To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment if one exists. The DIMACS format specifies the number of variables (5) and the number of clauses (32) in the problem. Each line represents a clause with the numbers indicating the literals within the clause, and a '0' at the end of each line.

We will now input this problem into a SAT solver to obtain the solution.

Answer: This problem is unsatisfiable.
