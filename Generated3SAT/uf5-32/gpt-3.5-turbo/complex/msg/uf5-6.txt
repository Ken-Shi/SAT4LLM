To solve this SAT problem in DIMACS format, we can use a SAT solver. However, since we know the answer needs to be included in the response, we can solve this manually. 

Let's analyze the problem:
The problem consists of 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and 32 clauses.

We need to assign true or false values to each variable to satisfy all the clauses.

Looking at the clauses, we see there are many 3-clauses and 2-clauses. Let's focus on the 3-clauses first since they involve more variables.

Clause 3: 3 1 2 0 can only be satisfied when variables 3 is true and variables 1 and 2 are false. So, assign 3 = True, 1 = False, 2 = False.

Now, let's continue evaluating clauses using this assignment. 

- The clause 5 1 3 0 can only be satisfied if 5 = False, 1 = False, and 3 = True. 
- The clause 3 4 5 0 can only be satisfied if 3 = T, 4 = T, and 5 = F. 
- The clause 5 4 3 0 can only be satisfied with 5 = F, 4 = T, and 3 = T.

Assigning these values, we find:

1 = False
2 = False
3 = True
4 = True
5 = False

Therefore, the solution is:
answer: 1 = False, 2 = False, 3 = True, 4 = True, 5 = False.
