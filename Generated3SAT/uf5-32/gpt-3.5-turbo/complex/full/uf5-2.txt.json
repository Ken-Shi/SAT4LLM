The DIMACS format specifies the number of variables (5) and the number of clauses (32) in the problem. Each line represents a clause with the numbers indicating the literals within the clause, and a '0' at the end of each line.\n\nWe will now input this problem into a SAT solver to obtain the solution.\n\nAnswer: This problem is unsatisfiable."
