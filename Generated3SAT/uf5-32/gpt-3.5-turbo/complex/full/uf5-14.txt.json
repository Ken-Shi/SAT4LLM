Let's start with the first clause:\n\n-5 3 -2 0\n\nThis clause can be satisfied by setting all variables to false except for variable 3.\n\nNext, let's consider the rest of the clauses. By examining all the provided clauses, we can see that there are multiple conflicting clauses that cannot be satisfied simultaneously. For example, clauses like \"3 -1 4 0\" and \"-1 4 3 0\" cannot both be satisfied at the same time.\n\nGiven these conflicting clauses, it is not possible to find a solution that satisfies all clauses concurrently.\n\nTherefore, the SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format is unsatisfiable.\n\nanswer: unsatisfiable"
