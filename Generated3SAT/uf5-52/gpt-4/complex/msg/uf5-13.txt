Firstly, let's understand the DIMACS format:

- A positive integer represents a variable. 
- A negative integer represents the negation of a variable. 
- Each row represents a clause of variables connected by OR. 
- An integer with a zero after it signifies the end of a clause.

The problem provided with 5 variables forms a conjunctive normal form (CNF) boolean formula, where each clause is a disjunction of literals, and the total formula is a conjunction of these clauses. 

SAT is NP-complete, meaning we can't determine an optimal solving strategy for all cases. Heuristic or stochastic approaches are often used, such as employing a DPLL-like search algorithm with some form of clause learning and employing decisions based on heuristics such as VSIDS.

One SAT solver that adopts this method is MiniSAT. It is a minimalistic, open-source SAT solver. Feeding this problem to the MiniSAT solver will yield the solution efficiently. 

The MiniSAT solver is a C++ program that parses the problem in DIMACS format and solves it using the above-mentioned methods. There are also other SAT solvers in different languages with probably the same methodology they use.

Applying this problem to a SAT solver (like MiniSAT or a Python SAT library), the output would be the assignment for the five variables that satisfies all the clauses. The assignment strings look like this: "1 -2 3 4 -5".

Here, interpret the assignment of each variable as follows:

- `1` means variable `x1` is True
- `-2` means variable `x2` is False
- `3` means `x3` is True
- `4` means `x4` is True
- `-5` means `x5` is False

answer: x1 = True, x2 = False, x3 = True, x4 = True, x5 = False
