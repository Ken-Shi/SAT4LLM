The DIMACS CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) format is a simple text format to express boolean formulas for SAT (Satisfiability) problems. Firstly, each number represents a literal (a variable or its negation). "0" is a delimiter, and each line between "p cnf 5 52" and the final "0" represents a clause. Our task is to find an assignment of true/false to the 5 variables that satisfies all of the clauses.

This problem can be solved using the DPLL algorithm, a highly efficient SAT algorithm used to decide the satisfiability of propositional logic formulas in conjunctive normal form. The DPLL algorithm combines backtracking with a set of powerful techniques based on the properties of propositional logic, such as unit propagation and pure literal elimination.

The initial propositional variables we have are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Let?s try assigning true (T) to variable 1 and run through unit propagation. This may lead to contradictions, so we backtrack and assign false (F) to variable 1.

To simplify, the negative number symbolizes the negation of a literal. If a clause contains both a literal and its negation, then the clause is always satisfied, so we can remove these clauses.

Analyzing the given clauses, we can derive values for our variables:

- From clause -4 5 1 0, we can derive since -4 is F, and we have F or 5 or 1, at least one of 5 or 1 must be T. Let's try 5=T, 1=F.
- In the clause 2 1 3 0, we can have 2=T, 1=F, and 3=T, since it satisfies the clause.
- Going through the clauses again, we can adjust 4=T, as -4 has been found as F in several cases but there are no cases where -5 is found, so 5=T can be consistent.

Keep repeating this approach until we have assigned a value to each of the propositions. If a contradiction is reached, we backtrack and try another assignment.

After traversing through all the clauses, one possible assignment could be:

1=F, 2=T, 3=T, 4=T, 5=T

Final Answer:
1=-1, 2=1, 3=1, 4=1, 5=1

Note: The "answer" field here is in the DIMACS output format, which always provides the value of the variable as either -1 (for False) or 1 (for True).
