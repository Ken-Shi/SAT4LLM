This is a propositional logic problem in conjunctive normal form (CNF), specifically it's a type of problem called a "boolean satisfiability problem" (SAT problem). The provided problem is composed of 52 clauses with 5 different variables (1 to 5), and our goal is to assign each of these variables a value either true or false such that the entire problem becomes true. The '0's after a sequence mean the end of a clause. Negative signs before numbers mean the negation of a variable.

It's a standard problem in computer science, and there are many ways to solve it. A common approach is the DPLL (Davis?Putnam?Logemann?Loveland) algorithm, which is a form of depth-first search. Here is a simple version of how DPLL works:

1) Simplify the problem as much as possible: If a variable appears with the same polarity in all clauses, assign it the value that satisfies all those clauses. This is called "unit propagation".

2) Choose an unassigned variable and guess its value, splitting the problem into two branches. 

3) For each branch, go back to step 1 and repeat until you find a solution or all variables are assigned a value and the problem is still unsatisfied.

4) If all variables are assigned and the problem is still unsatisfied, backtrack to the most recent guess and change its value. 

Often, it's best to implement a formula simplification first, applying the unit propagation rule and simplifying the entire formula. Each clause of the formula, in which a literal appears with a value that makes the clause valid, can be deleted. Each occurrence of a literal with an opposite sign can be deleted from a clause. This should be iterated until no more unit clauses can be derived. Backjumping (jumping back multiple levels) can be effectively used in this case, as in many instances, you can go back several decisions.

Using above philosophy, and upon using a SAT Solver, the result here in the format {1:true, 2:true, 3:true, 4:true, 5:true}. The boolean assignment that makes the whole problem statement true.

Answer: {1:true, 2:true, 3:true, 4:true, 5:true}
