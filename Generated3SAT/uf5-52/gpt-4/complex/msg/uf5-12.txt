This problem is a Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT), which is about finding assignments to boolean variables that make the formula (represented as a conjunction of disjuncts) true. 

The problem is given in the DIMACS format, where each row represents a clause and each clause is a disjunction of literals (either a variable, or its negation) separated by a space, with a 0 at the end of each row representing the end of each clause. 

The different numbers represent different variables and the "-" sign represents negation. So, for instance, "4 5 -1 0" represents the clause "(4 OR 5 OR NOT 1)".

With the above in mind, the problem is solved generally by finding a valid configuration for the variables such that it satisfies all the clauses in the problem. 

There are many possible approaches to solving SAT problems, such as the DPLL Algorithm. We'll use this approach, which works by selecting variables and trying all of their possible values, recursing on each possibility, and backtracking as soon as we find a configuration that doesn't work.

Here are the steps:
1. Select an unassigned variable. 
2. Assign it a random legal value.
3. Repeat the above until a satisfying variable assignment is found or no legal assignment exists.

However, it's important to know that SAT is NP-hard so as the problem scale increases, the time to solve it can increase substantially.

Taking into account the above steps, a valid configuration would be:

answer:  [False, False, True, True, True] 

This assignment corresponds to values for the 5 variables: -1, -2, 3, 4, 5, which means all clauses in the SAT problem are satisfied under this assignment.
