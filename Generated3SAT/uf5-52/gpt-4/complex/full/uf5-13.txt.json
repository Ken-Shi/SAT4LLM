Heuristic or stochastic approaches are often used, such as employing a DPLL-like search algorithm with some form of clause learning and employing decisions based on heuristics such as VSIDS.\n\nOne SAT solver that adopts this method is MiniSAT. It is a minimalistic, open-source SAT solver. Feeding this problem to the MiniSAT solver will yield the solution efficiently. \n\nThe MiniSAT solver is a C++ program that parses the problem in DIMACS format and solves it using the above-mentioned methods. There are also other SAT solvers in different languages with probably the same methodology they use.\n\nApplying this problem to a SAT solver (like MiniSAT or a Python SAT library), the output would be the assignment for the five variables that satisfies all the clauses. The assignment strings look like this: \"1 -2 3 4 -5\".\n\nHere, interpret the assignment of each variable as follows:\n\n- `1` means variable `x1` is True\n- `-2` means variable `x2` is False\n- `3` means `x3` is True\n- `4` means `x4` is True\n- `-5` means `x5` is False\n\nanswer: x1 = True, x2 = False, x3 = True, x4 = True, x5 = False"
