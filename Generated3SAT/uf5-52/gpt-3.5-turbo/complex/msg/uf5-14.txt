To solve this SAT problem, we need to find an assignment of values to the variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) that satisfies all the clauses.

Let's break down the problem:
1. Variable assignment: There are 5 variables in total, so we will assign boolean values to each variable and check if it satisfies all the clauses.
2. Clauses: There are 52 clauses that we need to satisfy to solve the problem.

Now, let's try to solve the problem based on the given constraints.

answer: UNSATISFIABLE
