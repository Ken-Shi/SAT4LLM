To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to analyze the clauses and try to find a satisfying assignment that makes all the clauses true.

Let's analyze the clauses one by one:

1. {-1, -3, -2} - Can't have both 1 and 3, so let's set them to false. Setting 2 to false as well.
2. {-5, -3, 1} - Setting 5 and 3 to false, forcing 1 to true.
3. {-2, -5, 1} - Setting 2 and 5 to false, forcing 1 to true.
4. {-5, -3, -4} - Setting 5 and 3 to false, forcing 4 to false.
5. {1, -3, -2} - Setting 1 to true, forcing 3 and 2 to false.
6. {4, -2, -5} - Setting 4 to true, forcing 2 and 5 to false.
7. {-2, -5, -1} - Setting 2 and 5 to false, forcing 1 to false.
8. {-2, -3, -4} - Setting 2 and 3 to false, forcing 4 to false.
9. {4, 1, -5} - Setting 4 and 1 to true, forcing 5 to false.
10. {-3, -5, -2} - Setting 3 and 5 to false, forcing 2 to false.
11. {-2, -3, 1} - Setting 2 and 3 to false, forcing 1 to true.
12. {-3, 1, -4} - Setting 3 and 1 to false, forcing 4 to false.
13. {1, -4, 3} - Setting 1 and 3 to true, forcing 4 to false.
14. {3, -5, 1} - Setting 3 and 5 to false, forcing 1 to true.
15. {5, -4, 1} - Setting 5 and 4 to false, forcing 1 to true.

By analyzing the rest of the clauses, we can see that the only assignment that satisfies all clauses is: 
1 = True
2 = False
3 = False
4 = False
5 = False

Therefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:
answer: 1 -2 -3 -4 -5
