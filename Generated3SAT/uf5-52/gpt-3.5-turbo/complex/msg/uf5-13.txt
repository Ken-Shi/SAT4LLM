To solve this SAT problem, we need to find a satisfying assignment of true/false values for the variables that make all the clauses true.

Let's start by analyzing the DIMACS format provided:

- There are 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- There are a total of 52 clauses

Now, we will use a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment:

answer: SAT
1=true, 2=false, 3=false, 4=true, 5=true
