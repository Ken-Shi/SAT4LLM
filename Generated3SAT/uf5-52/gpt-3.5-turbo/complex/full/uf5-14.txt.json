Variable assignment: There are 5 variables in total, so we will assign boolean values to each variable and check if it satisfies all the clauses.\n2. Clauses: There are 52 clauses that we need to satisfy to solve the problem.\n\nNow, let's try to solve the problem based on the given constraints.\n\nanswer: UNSATISFIABLE"
