Setting 2 to false as well.\n2. {-5, -3, 1} - Setting 5 and 3 to false, forcing 1 to true.\n3. {-2, -5, 1} - Setting 2 and 5 to false, forcing 1 to true.\n4. {-5, -3, -4} - Setting 5 and 3 to false, forcing 4 to false.\n5. {1, -3, -2} - Setting 1 to true, forcing 3 and 2 to false.\n6. {4, -2, -5} - Setting 4 to true, forcing 2 and 5 to false.\n7. {-2, -5, -1} - Setting 2 and 5 to false, forcing 1 to false.\n8. {-2, -3, -4} - Setting 2 and 3 to false, forcing 4 to false.\n9. {4, 1, -5} - Setting 4 and 1 to true, forcing 5 to false.\n10. {-3, -5, -2} - Setting 3 and 5 to false, forcing 2 to false.\n11. {-2, -3, 1} - Setting 2 and 3 to false, forcing 1 to true.\n12. {-3, 1, -4} - Setting 3 and 1 to false, forcing 4 to false.\n13. {1, -4, 3} - Setting 1 and 3 to true, forcing 4 to false.\n14. {3, -5, 1} - Setting 3 and 5 to false, forcing 1 to true.\n15. {5, -4, 1} - Setting 5 and 4 to false, forcing 1 to true.\n\nBy analyzing the rest of the clauses, we can see that the only assignment that satisfies all clauses is: \n1 = True\n2 = False\n3 = False\n4 = False\n5 = False\n\nTherefore, the solution to this SAT problem is:\nanswer: 1 -2 -3 -4 -5"
