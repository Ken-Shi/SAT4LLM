The clauses have a mix of unary (not) and binary (or) operations, which is not allowed in the DIMACS format. A proper DIMACS format clause should only consist of literals connected by OR operators.\n- Therefore, the presented SAT problem cannot be solved in its current form.\n\nThus, the SAT problem is unsolvable due to the inconsistency in the clause definitions.\n\nanswer: The SAT problem is unsolvable in its current form."
