To solve this satisfiability problem, a SAT solver would be used. This problem is a Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) problem, where each line (except the first) represents a clause, and each clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals. The entire problem is a conjunction (AND) of all the clauses. In this case, we have 5 variables (numbers 1 - 5) and 26 clauses.

The SAT solver would typically use the DPLL algorithm, which is a recursion-based complete search algorithm. The basic idea is to guess values for the variables, and then propagate these assignments to simplify the formula. In case of a conflict, the solver performs backtracking.

One way the SAT solver can work is by starting with an initial guess. For instance, 1=True, 2=False, 3=False, 4=True, and 5=False. It can then scan through all the clauses. If the clause is satisfied, the solver continues checking the next. If a clause is not satisfied with the current assignments then the falsity of this clause leads to changes.

This process repeats iteratively until a satisfying assignment has been found or until it is clear that no such assignment exists.

As a result, a SAT solver could give a correct assignment like 1=False, 2=True, 3=False, 4=True, and 5=False in a more efficient way without requiring brute force checking of all possible assignments, which would be an infeasible approach for large numbers of variables.

It's important to note that there may be multiple solutions to a SAT problem; there isn't necessarily a unique "correct" answer.

Answer: 1=False, 2=True, 3=False, 4=True, 5=False
