The DIMACS format is used to define SAT problems, a basic problem concerned with the satisfiability of logical formulas. The goal is to find whether there exist assignments to the variables such that the entire formula is true. If assignments exist such that the entire formula can be satisfied, the assignments are said to be 'solutions' to the problem. 

The DIMACS format expresses the problem as:

- a line 'p cnf 5 26' specifying the problem is in propositional conjunctive normal form (cnf), has 5 variables and 26 clauses.
- 26 lines, each line ending in zero, representing a disjunction of literals (variables or their negations).
- A literal's sign determines whether the variable is negated - a positive one represents the variable, a negative one its negation.
- Multiple literals in a line effectively mean an OR operation between them.
- Implicitly, an AND operation connects clauses together.

Now, by guessing and verifying different assignments to the variables, we observe:

- Looking at the first five lines, we can immediately see that there are mutually exclusive clauses, meaning that for any assignment at least one clause will always be false. For solutions to exist, all clauses must be true.
- For instance, in the first clause (2 3 4 0), assuming all to be true where 2, 3 and 4 stand for respective variable assignments. But if we look at the seventh line (-1 -3 0), this means variable 1 and 3 cannot both be true. This is in direct contradiction with our assumption and the fifth clause (1 2 3 0) which requires variable 1 and 3 to be true.
- Therefore, it's impossible to satisfy all clauses simultaneously, causing the formulation to be unsatisfiable.

Answer: The SAT problem does not have a solution. The given clauses are unsatisfiable.
