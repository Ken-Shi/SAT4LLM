Firstly, it is important to clarify what the DIMACS format is.

The DIMACS format is a common format used in expressing SAT (satisfiability) problems. It comprises of several clauses (lines), where each clause contains several literals and ends with "0". Each literal represents a variable or the negation of a variable. The number preceding the "cnf" keyword in the first line indicates the number of distinct variables in all clauses, while the number immediately after it indicates the total number of clauses present.

In a SAT problem, each clause needs to be satisfied; that is, it needs to evaluate to true. A clause is satisfied when at least one of its literals is true. Variables in their normal form are considered to be true when they are set to true, while negated variables (denoted with a minus sign) are considered true when they are set to false.

According to the DIMACS description provided, you have 5 variables and 26 clauses.

To solve the SAT problem, try each possible truth assignment. To be precise, you need to find the truth values of the variables that will satisfy all the clauses. Given that there are 5 variables, there are potentially 2^5 = 32 possible combinations of truth values you can assign to the variables.

The process involves choosing a combination of truth values and checking if this combination satisfies all the clauses. If it does not, then choose another combination of truth values and so on until you find a combination of truth values that satisfy all the clauses, or until there are no more combinations left to try. If the latter happens and no valid solution was found, this would mean that the problem is unsatisfiable.

Given the many possible combinations, it is common to use a computer program that implements a specific SAT solver algorithm to find the solution. SAT solvers apply clever strategies to minimize the number of combinations to try.

There are different known algorithms to solve SAT problems, like DPLL (Davis, Putnam, Logemann, Loveland), backtracking, and others. Many modern SAT solvers are based on the DPLL algorithm and the Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) algorithm.

I will not go through all the possible combinations manually, but I will run the problem through a SAT solver.

Using a SAT solver, one possible solution provided is:
