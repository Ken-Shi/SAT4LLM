The problem provided is a conjunctive normal form boolean satisfiability problem (CNF SAT), where each line represents a clause, and we need to find a set of boolean values for the five variables (represented by the positive and negative of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) that makes all the clauses true. 

First, we'll traverse the list and keep track of the unsatisfied clauses. Initially, all clauses are unsatisfied. We'll then set each variable in the order they appear, seeking to minimize the number of unsatisfied clauses. 

1. Start by setting 1 = False. Clauses 4, 9 and 20 are now satisfied, leaving 23 unsatisfied clauses.
2. Then, set 2 = False. This satisfies clauses 2, 3, 7, 10, 18, 23 and 25 and leaves 16 unsatisfied clauses.
3. Set 3 = True. This satisfies clauses 5, 8, 11, 14, 21 and 22 and leaves 10 unsatisfied clauses.
4. Set 4 = False. This satisfies clauses 1, 6, 13, 15,16,19, 24 and 25 and leaves 2 unsatisfied clauses.
5. Finally, set 5 = True. This satisfies the remaining clauses, 12 and 17. No unsatisfied clauses remain.

Therefore, a solution is obtained where variable 1 is False, variable 2 is False, variable 3 is True, variable 4 is False, and variable 5 is True.

Answer: -1 -2 3 -4 5
