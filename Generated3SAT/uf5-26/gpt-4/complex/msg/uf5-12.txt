To solve this problem, I would initialize all variables (1 to 5 in our case) to False, indicating their current assignment is false. Then, I would iterate through each clause in order, in an attempt to satisfy the system.

In the DIMACS CNF (conjunctive normal form) format, each clause is represented by a line where each number represents a variable in the clause. Positive numbers denote the variable, and negative numbers represent the negation of the variable. A clause is considered satisfied if at least one of its literals (variables or negations) is true. The line ending in '0' represents the end of a clause.

The boolean SAT problem is NP-complete, meaning that in the worst case scenario, any algorithm will have to try every possible assignments.

A common algorithm for this problem is the DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) algorithm, which is a backtracking algorithm. It continually chooses a literal, assigns it a value, propagates the results, and checks if the new assignment yields a contradiction. If it does, the algorithm backtracks and tries a different assignment.

The process can be summarized as follows:

1. Choose an unassigned variable: make an arbitrary decision when possible. In a smarter version of the algorithm, this action could be more informed. For instance, choosing variables that appear most often in the remaining clauses.

2. Assign a bool value to the variable and simplify: propagate the implications of this assignment throughout the formula, simplifying the clauses as much as possible.

3. Check for conflict: if this assignment leads to a contradiction, backtrack and try the opposite value. If both values lead to a contradiction, return to a previous variable assignment and try a different value.

4. Check for completion: if all clauses are satisfied, then we have found a satisfying assignment of variables. If we have explored all variable assignments without satisfying the system, then the input is not satisfiable.

After applying the DPLL algorithm on given DIMACS CNF, we have following solution:

answer : 1 -2 -3 -4 -5
