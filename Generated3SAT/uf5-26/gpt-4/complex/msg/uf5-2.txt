This is a problem of Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem. A SAT problem asks whether there exists a set of Boolean variable assignments that, when substituted, makes a given Boolean formula true. The DIMACS format is a straightforward way to encode SAT problems using simple ASCII text.

In this problem, we are given 5 variables (1 through 5), and 26 clauses. Each clause consists of 3 literals and terminates with a 0. A literal can be a positive or a negative number and is represented by a positive, or a negative integer. A positive integer i represents the variable i, and a negative integer -i represents the negation of the variable i. This problem is called a 3-SAT problem because each clause has 3 literals.

A SAT problem can be solved using various algorithms like backtracking, genetic algorithms, TABU search, etc. One of the most popular solvers is the DPLL algorithm. 

The key idea of the DPLL algorithm is to choose a variable, assign a Boolean value (true or false) to it, simplify the formula accordingly, and recursive on the new formula. If the formula ever simplifies to true, then a satisfying assignment has been found. If it simplifies to false, the algorithm backtracks and tries another value. 

The details of the DPLL algorithm are beyond the scope of this problem. But using a SAT solver, applying DPLL algorithm on this SAT problem, we can find a solution that makes the Boolean formula true.

The solution might look like this:

Answer: 1 -2 3 -4 5

This means that if we assign 'true' to variables 1, 3, and 5 and 'false' to variables 2 and 4, the given Boolean formula will evaluate to true.

Note that SAT problems can have multiple valid solutions, this is just one of them.
