                "content": "Let's take a bird's eye view of this problem first. This is a CNF-SAT (Conjunctive Normal Form - Satisfiability) problem. A CNF-SAT problem asks if there's a way to assign truth values to a set of boolean variables that would make the whole formula true. A formula is given in conjunctive normal form if it's a conjunction (AND) of disjunctions (OR).\n\nEach line in the problem corresponds to one of the disjunctive clauses in the CNF, and we know that at least one literal inside each clause must be true for the whole formula to be true.\n\nLet's solve this problem step by step:\n\n1) The key strategy here is to apply the technique of \"Unit Propagation\". Whenever there exists a unit clause (a clause with only one unassigned variable) it will be assigned the truth value that makes the clause true, because it's the only way to satisfy that clause.\n\n2) From the clause -1 -5 -4 0, we can see -1, -5, -4 are negated, so they can be assigned False (0).\n  That means variables 1=0, 5=0, 4=0.\n\n3) Then, propagate these assignments, noticing the related clauses such as 2 -1 4 0, 2 needs to be True (1) to satisfy this clause because 1 and 4 are already False.\n\n   Similarly, from clause -4 2 -3 0, now 2 is positive and 4 is Negative, thus 3 should be False (0) to satisfy the clause.\n\n4) So far, we have 1=0, 2=1, 3=0, 4=0, 5=0.\n\n5) Double-check and it's clear that these assignments can indeed satisfy each of the given clauses.\n\nanswer: 1=0, 2=1, 3=0, 4=0, 5=0"
