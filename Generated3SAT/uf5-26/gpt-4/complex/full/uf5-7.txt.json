                "content": "In the DIMACS representation, each number is a literal, each line with 0 at the end is a clause, and we're finding values for each of the literals that satisfy all clauses.\n\nLet's go line by line and simplify. If a clause has both a literal and its negation, it's always true and we can discard it. If a clause has repeated literals, we can keep only one.\n\nOur simplified problem becomes: \np cnf 3 12\n1 -2 3 0\n-1 3 4 0\n3 4 5 0\n1 -4 3 0\n3 5 -2 0\n1 -3 4 0\n4 -2 1 0\n1 -2 -5 0\n4 -2 1 0\n1 4 -5 0\n-3 -2 -1 0\n5 4 -2 0\n\nWe can use any SAT solver to solve this problem. In this process, we try different assignments for the literals until we find one that satisfies all clauses. There are several strategies, like always choosing the literal that appears most often. This can be simplified with the help of a computer program.\n\nWe can set 1 to True, then clause 6 gives 3 = True, clause 5 gives 5 = True and clause 7 gives 4 = True. This assignment satisfies all clauses.\n\nAnswer: 1 = True, 2 = False, 3 = True, 4 = True, 5 = True"
