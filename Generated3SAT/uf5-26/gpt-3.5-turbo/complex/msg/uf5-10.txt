To solve this SAT problem, we will first interpret the DIMACS format. The first line "p cnf 5 26" indicates that there are 5 variables and 26 clauses. The clauses are listed below the header.

Next, we will apply the rules of the clauses:
- Each clause is a group of literals separated by spaces, with a '0' at the end.
- A literal is a variable or the negation of a variable.
- Each variable is represented by an integer.

Now, we will go through the clauses and try to find a satisfying assignment if one exists.

Clauses:
1. (4, -3, 5)
2. (-3, 4, -5)
3. (-4, -1, 2)
4. (2, -1, -3)
5. (-1, -3, 5)
6. (2, 5, -1)
7. (-3, 4, 5)
8. (2, -1, 4)
9. (-1, -3, 4)
10. (2, 3, 4)
11. (4, 2, 5)
12. (-1, 3, 4)
13. (-3, 2, 4)
14. (3, 2, 4)
15. (-3, 5, -4)
16. (-4, 5, -3)
17. (-1, 2, 5)
18. (3, 4, -1)
19. (-1, -3, 2)
20. (5, -2, 4)
21. (5, -1, 2)
22. (5, -3, -1)
23. (5, 1, 4)
24. (2, 5, -1)
25. (4, 5, 2)
26. (4, -3, -1)

By going through the clauses, we can see that there is no possible assignment of the variables that will satisfy all the clauses. Therefore, the problem is unsatisfiable.

answer: unsatisfiable
