To solve this SAT problem, we will need to convert the given CNF formula into a more readable form:

(1, 2, 5)
(-4, 5, -1)
(-3, 2, 5)
(3, -2, -1)
(-3, -1, 5)
(-1, 2, 3)
(-1, 2, -4)
(5, 3, -1)
(2, 3, -1)
(-1, -4, 2)
(-5, 4, -1)
(-1, 5, 2)
(-4, 3, -2)
(-3, -1, 2)
(3, -4, 2)
(5, -4, 2)
(5, -4, 3)
(3, -2, -4)
(5, -3, -1)
(-1, 2, 3)
(3, 5, -2)
(-3, -2, -4)
(2, 4, 1)
(3, 5, -1)
(2, -4, 5)
(2, -1, 5)

Next, we will apply the DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) algorithm to find a solution.

Starting with an empty assignment, we see that clauses (2, 4, 1) and (2, -4, 5) can be satisfied by setting variable 2 to true, variable 4 to true, and variable 1 to true.

This gives us the following assignment:
1: false
2: true
3: undetermined
4: true
5: undetermined

Now, we can propagate these assignments and see that variable 5 must also be set to true to satisfy clauses (1, 2, 5) and (-1, 5, 2).

This gives us the following assignment:
1: false
2: true
3: undetermined
4: true
5: true

At this point, we have satisfied all clauses, and the assignment {1: false, 2: true, 3: undetermined, 4: true, 5: true} is the solution to the SAT problem.

Final answer:
answer: 1 -2 -3 4 5
