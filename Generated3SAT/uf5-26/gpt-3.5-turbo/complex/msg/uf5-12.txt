To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to analyze each clause and see if there is a consistent assignment of true or false values to the variables that satisfies all clauses. 

The variables in this problem are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Let's evaluate each clause one by one:

1. -4 2 -5 0: This clause can be satisfied if we set 1=False, 2=True, 3=True, 4=False, 5=False
2. 2 -5 1 0: This clause can be satisfied with the assignment from clause 1
3. 1 5 2 0: This clause can be satisfied with the assignment from clause 1
4. 3 5 -4 0: This clause can be satisfied with the assignment from clause 1
5. -5 -2 1 0: This clause can be satisfied with the assignment from clause 1
6. -5 -2 1 0: Already counted in previous clause
7. 3 1 -4 0: This clause can be satisfied with the assignment from clause 1
8. 1 5 -4 0: This clause can be satisfied with the assignment from clause 1
9. -4 3 5 0: This clause can be satisfied with the assignment from clause 1
10. 5 -3 -4 0: This clause can be satisfied with the assignment from clause 1
11. 3 5 -4 0: Already counted in previous clauses
12. -5 3 -4 0: This clause can be satisfied with the assignment from clause 1
13. -4 -5 -3 0: This clause can be satisfied with the assignment from clause 1
14. 1 5 3 0: This clause can be satisfied with the assignment from clause 1
15. -5 1 -4 0: This clause can be satisfied with the assignment from clause 1
16. 3 -2 1 0: This clause can be satisfied with the assignment from clause 1
17. 1 2 -5 0: This clause can be satisfied with the assignment from clause 1
18. 3 -5 2 0: This clause can be satisfied with the assignment from clause 1
19. 1 3 -4 0: This clause can be satisfied with the assignment from clause 1
20. 1 -4 3 0: This clause can be satisfied with the assignment from clause 1
21. 4 1 2 0: This clause can be satisfied with the assignment from clause 1
22. -1 -4 3 0: This clause can be satisfied if we set 1=False, 2=True, 3=True, 4=False, 5=False
23. -3 -4 2 0: This clause can be satisfied with the assignment from clause 1
24. 1 3 2 0: This clause can be satisfied with the assignment from clause 1
25. -1 3 -5 0: This clause can be satisfied with the assignment from clause 1
26. 2 -5 1 0: Already counted in previous clauses

Therefore, the consistent assignment that satisfies all clauses is:
1=False, 2=True, 3=True, 4=False, 5=False

answer: 1=False, 2=True, 3=True, 4=False, 5=False
