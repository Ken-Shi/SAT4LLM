The DIMACS format specifies that the problem is in conjunctive normal form (CNF) with 5 variables and 26 clauses.\n\nAfter running this through a SAT solver, we find that the solution is:\n- Variable 1 is True\n- Variable 2 is False\n- Variable 3 is False\n- Variable 4 is False\n- Variable 5 is True\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nanswer: 1 0 -2 -3 -4 5"
