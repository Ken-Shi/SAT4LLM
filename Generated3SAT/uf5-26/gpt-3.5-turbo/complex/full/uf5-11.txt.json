We have 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and the 26 clauses given in the DIMACS format.\n2. We can start by trying to satisfy each of the clauses one by one.\n3. For example, the first clause \"-4 -2 -1 0\" can be satisfied by assigning true values to variables 4, 2, and 1.\n4. Similarly, we can go through each of the 26 clauses to see if there is a combination of variable assignments that satisfies all of them.\n\nAfter checking all the clauses, we can arrive at the final answer:\n\nanswer: 1 -2 -3 -4 -5"
