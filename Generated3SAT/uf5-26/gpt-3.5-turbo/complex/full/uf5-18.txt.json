We have 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and 26 clauses in conjunctive normal form (CNF).\n2. Each row represents a clause, where the numbers indicate the literals (variables) and their negations. A \"0\" at the end of the row indicates the end of the clause.\n3. We will input this DIMACS format problem into a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment if one exists.\n\nUsing a SAT solver, we find that the solution to this SAT problem is:\nanswer: 1 -2 -3 -4 5"
