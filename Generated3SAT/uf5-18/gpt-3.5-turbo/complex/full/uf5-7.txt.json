(!2 OR !5 OR 3)\n2. (2 OR !3 OR !5)\n3. (2 OR !5 OR !3)\n4. (!5 OR 3 OR 2)\n5. (!5 OR 2 OR 4)\n6. (!3 OR !1 OR 2)\n7. (!5 OR 2 OR !3)\n8. (!5 OR 2 OR 4)\n9. (4 OR 1 OR 5)\n10. (!5 OR 2 OR 4)\n11. (1 OR !3 OR !5)\n12. (!3 OR 1 OR !5)\n13. (2 OR !5 OR 4)\n14. (!3 OR !5 OR 1)\n15. (2 OR !1 OR !5)\n16. (!3 OR 2 OR 4)\n17. (!2 OR !1 OR !3)\n18. (4 OR !5 OR !1)\n\nLet's start solving the clauses one by one:\n1. Clause 1 is satisfied when 5 is true.\n2. Clause 2 is satisfied when 2 is true.\n3. Clause 3 is satisfied when 2 is true.\n4. Clause 4 is satisfied when 5 is true.\n5. Clause 5 is satisfied when 5 is true.\n6. Clause 6 is satisfied when 3 is true.\n7. Clause 7 is satisfied when 2 is true.\n8. Clause 8 is satisfied when 2 is true.\n9. Clause 9 is satisfied when 1 is true.\n10. Clause 10 is satisfied when 2 is true.\n11. Clause 11 is satisfied when 1 is true.\n12. Clause 12 is satisfied when 1 is true.\n13. Clause 13 is satisfied when 2 is true.\n14. Clause 14 is satisfied when 5 is true.\n15. Clause 15 is satisfied when 2 is true.\n16. Clause 16 is satisfied when 2 is true.\n17. Clause 17 is satisfied when none of the variables are true.\n18. Clause 18 is satisfied when 4 is true.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the SAT problem is:\nanswer: 2 1 -3 -4 5"
