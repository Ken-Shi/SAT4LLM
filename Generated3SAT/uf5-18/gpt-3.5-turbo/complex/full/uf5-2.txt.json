(1 or -2 or 4): Assigning 1 and 4 to true would make this clause true.\n2. (4 or -5 or -2): Assigning 4 to true would make this clause true.\n3. (5 or -1 or -3): Assigning 5 to true would make this clause true.\n4. (-2 or -3 or -1): Assigning -2 and -3 would make this clause true.\n5. (5 or 4 or -2): Assigning 5 and 4 would make this clause true.\n6. (3 or 5 or -1): Assigning 3 and 5 would make this clause true.\n7. (5 or 4 or -1): Assigning 5 and 4 would make this clause true.\n8. (4 or -2 or 5): Assigning 4 to true would make this clause true.\n9. (-3 or 4 or 5): Assigning 4 and 5 would make this clause true.\n10. (4 or -3 or -2): Assigning 4 to true would make this clause true.\n11. (1 or -2 or -3): Assigning 1 to true would make this clause true.\n12. (4 or -1 or -2): Assigning 4 to true would make this clause true.\n13. (-1 or -2 or -4): Assigning -1 and -4 would make this clause true.\n14. (-3 or 5 or -1): Assigning -1 and 5 would make this clause true.\n15. (-2 or -3 or 5): Assigning -2 and 5 would make this clause true.\n16. (-1 or 4 or -3): Assigning -1 and 4 would make this clause true.\n17. (-3 or 4 or 5): Assigning 4 and 5 would make this clause true.\n18. (5 or -2 or 4): Assigning 5 and 4 would make this clause true.\n\nTherefore, the satisfying assignment for this SAT problem is:\n1. 1=true, 2=false, 3=false, 4=true, 5=true\n\nanswer: 1 -2 -3 4 5"
