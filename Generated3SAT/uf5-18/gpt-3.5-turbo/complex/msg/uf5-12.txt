To solve the SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use a SAT solver. However, we can also reason through it manually since the problem is small.

The DIMACS format provided encodes a SAT problem with 5 variables and 18 clauses. Each line after "p cnf 5 18" represents a clause. Each number represents a literal, with a trailing 0 indicating the end of the clause.

We will now try to derive a solution by analyzing the clauses:
1. Clause 1: (-1 2 5) - At least one of variables 1, 2, or 5 is true.
2. Clause 2: (2 -4 3) - At least one of variables 2, -4, or 3 is true.
3. Clause 3: (-2 1 3) - At least one of variables -2, 1, or 3 is true.
4. Clause 4: (-2 3 1) - At least one of variables -2, 3, or 1 is true.
5. Clause 5: (5 2 3) - At least one of variables 5, 2, or 3 is true.
6. Clause 6: (-5 4 1) - At least one of variables -5, 4, or 1 is true.
7. Clause 7: (-2 5 1) - At least one of variables -2, 5, or 1 is true.
8. Clause 8: (3 4 5) - At least one of variables 3, 4, or 5 is true.
9. Clause 9: (1 2 3) - At least one of variables 1, 2, or 3 is true.
10. Clause 10: (5 3 4) - At least one of variables 5, 3, or 4 is true.
11. Clause 11: (1 5 3) - At least one of variables 1, 5, or 3 is true.
12. Clause 12: (4 5 3) - At least one of variables 4, 5, or 3 is true.
13. Clause 13: (2 3 5) - At least one of variables 2, 3, or 5 is true.
14. Clause 14: (-4 2 3) - At least one of variables -4, 2, or 3 is true.
15. Clause 15: (5 3 1) - At least one of variables 5, 3, or 1 is true.
16. Clause 16: (3 1 5) - At least one of variables 3, 1, or 5 is true.
17. Clause 17: (-5 1 2) - At least one of variables -5, 1, or 2 is true.
18. Clause 18: (3 2 4) - At least one of variables 3, 2, or 4 is true.

Now, we need to find an assignment of true/false values to variables 1 to 5 that satisfies all clauses. Let's go through the clauses and variables to find a satisfying assignment.

From clauses 4, 9, and 16, we can deduce that variable 3 must be true. This also makes clause 5 true (from clause 5).

Considering variable 3 is true, we can then deduce that variables 1 (from clause 16 and 9) and 5 (from clause 11) must also be true. Now, we have variables 1, 3, and 5 as true.

Next, from clause 8 with 3 being true, we can infer that variables 4 must also be true. This satisfies clause 8. Now we have variables 1, 3, 4, and 5 as true.

Finally, variable 2 must be assigned false to satisfy clause 3 (as variable 3 is true).

Therefore, the satisfying assignment is:
1. Variable 1 is true
2. Variable 2 is false
3. Variable 3 is true
4. Variable 4 is true
5. Variable 5 is true

answer: 1 -2 3 4 5
