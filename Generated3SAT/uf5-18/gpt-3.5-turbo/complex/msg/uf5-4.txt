To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we can use the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm or any SAT solver. Below is one possible solution:

Line of thoughts:
1. Encoding:
- We have 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and 18 clauses.
- Each line represents a clause, with '0' at the end of each clause indicating the end.
2. Solution:
- We can use a SAT solver to determine whether there exists an assignment of truth values to the variables that satisfies all the clauses.

Final Answer:
answer: 1 2 -3 -4 -5
