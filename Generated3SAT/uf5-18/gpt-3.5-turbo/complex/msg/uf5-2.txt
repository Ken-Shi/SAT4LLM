To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to find a satisfying assignment that makes all the clauses true. Let's evaluate each clause one by one:

1. (1 or -2 or 4): Assigning 1 and 4 to true would make this clause true.
2. (4 or -5 or -2): Assigning 4 to true would make this clause true.
3. (5 or -1 or -3): Assigning 5 to true would make this clause true.
4. (-2 or -3 or -1): Assigning -2 and -3 would make this clause true.
5. (5 or 4 or -2): Assigning 5 and 4 would make this clause true.
6. (3 or 5 or -1): Assigning 3 and 5 would make this clause true.
7. (5 or 4 or -1): Assigning 5 and 4 would make this clause true.
8. (4 or -2 or 5): Assigning 4 to true would make this clause true.
9. (-3 or 4 or 5): Assigning 4 and 5 would make this clause true.
10. (4 or -3 or -2): Assigning 4 to true would make this clause true.
11. (1 or -2 or -3): Assigning 1 to true would make this clause true.
12. (4 or -1 or -2): Assigning 4 to true would make this clause true.
13. (-1 or -2 or -4): Assigning -1 and -4 would make this clause true.
14. (-3 or 5 or -1): Assigning -1 and 5 would make this clause true.
15. (-2 or -3 or 5): Assigning -2 and 5 would make this clause true.
16. (-1 or 4 or -3): Assigning -1 and 4 would make this clause true.
17. (-3 or 4 or 5): Assigning 4 and 5 would make this clause true.
18. (5 or -2 or 4): Assigning 5 and 4 would make this clause true.

Therefore, the satisfying assignment for this SAT problem is:
1. 1=true, 2=false, 3=false, 4=true, 5=true

answer: 1 -2 -3 4 5
