To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we need to analyze each clause and try to find a assignment of true or false to each variable that satisfies all the clauses.

The DIMACS format provided can be translated as follows:
- Clause 1: (5 or -1 or 2)
- Clause 2: (-3 or -1 or 2)
- Clause 3: (-5 or -2 or 3)
- Clause 4: (3 or -5 or -1)
- Clause 5: (3 or -1 or 4)
- Clause 6: (2 or -5 or 3)
- Clause 7: (-5 or 4 or -1)
- Clause 8: (-1 or -5 or 2)
- Clause 9: (4 or 3 or 2)
- Clause 10: (-5 or 2 or -1)
- Clause 11: (-5 or 4 or -1)
- Clause 12: (4 or -1 or 3)
- Clause 13: (-5 or -2 or 4)
- Clause 14: (-5 or -1 or 4)
- Clause 15: (-5 or 2 or 4)
- Clause 16: (2 or -5 or -1)
- Clause 17: (-1 or 2 or 3)
- Clause 18: (-1 or -3 or 2)

We will now try to find a satisfying assignment:

Let's start with assigning 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as True and assign -1, -2, -3, -4, -5 as False.
With the given assignment, 
- Clause 1 is satisfied by 1, 2, 5 being True.
- Clause 2 is satisfied by -3 being False.
- Clause 3 is satisfied by -5 being False.
- Clause 4 is satisfied by 3 being True.
- Clause 5 is satisfied by 3 being True.
- Clause 6 is satisfied by 2, 3 being True.
- Clause 7 is satisfied by -5 being False.
- Clause 8 is satisfied by -1 being False.
- Clause 9 is satisfied by 2, 3, 4 being True.
- Clause 10 is satisfied by -1 being False.
- Clause 11 is satisfied by -1 being False.
- Clause 12 is satisfied by 3 being True.
- Clause 13 is satisfied by -5 being False.
- Clause 14 is satisfied by -5 being False.
- Clause 15 is satisfied by 2 being True.
- Clause 16 is satisfied by 2 being True.
- Clause 17 is satisfied by 2, 3 being True.
- Clause 18 is satisfied by 2 being True.

Therefore, the satisfying assignment is:
1 = False
2 = True
3 = True
4 = True
5 = False

answer: 2 3 4
