To solve this problem, we need to find a satisfying assignment for the given CNF formula. 

The CNF formula has 5 variables (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and 18 clauses. 

Let's go through each clause and try to find a satisfying assignment:

1. (4 1 2 0) - This clause is satisfied if either 1 or 2 is true. 
2. (5 2 1 0) - This clause is satisfied if either 1 or 2 is true. 
3. (3 2 1 0) - This clause is satisfied if either 1 or 2 is true. 
4. (4 -5 -1 0) - This clause is satisfied if 4 is true. 
5. (5 4 3 0) - This clause is satisfied if 4 is true. 
6. (-5 4 2 0) - This clause is satisfied if 4 is true. 
7. (-3 2 4 0) - This clause is satisfied if 2 is true. 
8. (3 -5 4 0) - This clause is satisfied if 4 is true. 
9. (5 1 3 0) - This clause is satisfied if either 1 or 3 is true. 
10. (1 4 5 0) - This clause is satisfied if either 1 or 4 is true. 
11. (4 2 3 0) - This clause is satisfied if either 2 or 3 is true. 
12. (-3 4 1 0) - This clause is satisfied if either 1 or 4 is true. 
13. (1 4 2 0) - This clause is satisfied if either 1 or 4 is true. 
14. (2 1 4 0) - This clause is satisfied if either 1 or 2 is true. 
15. (1 -4 2 0) - This clause is satisfied if either 1 or 2 is true. 
16. (1 4 2 0) - This clause is satisfied if either 1 or 4 is true. 
17. (-2 4 1 0) - This clause is satisfied if either 1 or 4 is true. 
18. (-2 1 -5 0) - This clause is satisfied if either 1 or 5 is true. 

Therefore, a satisfying assignment for this CNF formula would be: 
1 = True
2 = True
3 = False
4 = True
5 = False

So, the final answer is: 
answer: 1 1 0 -1 1 0
