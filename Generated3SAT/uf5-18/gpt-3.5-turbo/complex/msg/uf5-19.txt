To solve the SAT problem provided, we need to analyze the DIMACS format given. The first line "p cnf 5 18" indicates that there are 5 variables and 18 clauses in the CNF (conjunctive normal form) formula.

Next, we list the 18 clauses represented in CNF format:
1. (-1 v 2 v -4)
2. (-1 v 2 v 5)
3. (-5 v -4 v 1)
4. (3 v -2 v -4)
5. (5 v 3 v -2)
6. (3 v 1 v -4)
7. (-2 v -4 v 3)
8. (-2 v -4 v -1)
9. (-1 v -4 v -2)
10. (-4 v 1 v 3)
11. (5 v 2 v -4)
12. (3 v 5 v -4)
13. (4 v 5 v 1)
14. (3 v -2 v -4)
15. (-4 v 2 v 5)
16. (3 v 5 v 1)
17. (4 v 3 v 1)
18. (-2 v 3 v 1)

Now, we can start solving the SAT problem by applying the unit propagation and pure literal elimination techniques. 

Unit Propagation: 
From clause 10, we have (-4 v 1 v 3), so -4 must be true, which makes clauses 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 15, and 17 true. 
Additionally, from clause 13, we have (4 v 5 v 1), so 4 must be true.

Pure Literal Elimination:
Since 4 is true, clauses 13 and 17 are satisfied.

Now, let's update the remaining clauses:
1. (-1 v 2)
2. (-1 v 2 v 5)
3. (-5 v 1)
4. (3 v -2)
5. (5 v 3 v -2)
6. (3 v 1)
7. (-2)
8. (-2)
9. (-1)
10. (1 v 3)
11. (5 v 2)
12. (3 v 5)
15. (5 v 2)
16. (3 v 5)
18. (3)

Now, we can see that all remaining clauses have unit clauses and can be satisfied as follows:
-1, 2, -2, 1, 3, -3, -5 are true.

Therefore, the final answer is:
answer: 1 -2 3 4 -5
