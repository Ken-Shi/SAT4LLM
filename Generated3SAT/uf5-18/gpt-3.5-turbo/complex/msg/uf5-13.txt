To solve this problem, we need to find a satisfying assignment that makes the formula true. The DIMACS format given represents a SAT problem with 5 variables and 18 clauses. 

We can solve this problem using a SAT solver or manually by examining the clauses.

Let's analyze the clauses:
1. -4 2 1 - This clause can be satisfied by setting 4 to false, 2 to true and 1 to true.
2. 2 -3 1 - This clause can be satisfied by setting 2 to true, 3 to false and 1 to true.
3. -5 -3 -2 - This clause can be satisfied by setting 5 to false, 3 to false and 2 to false.
4. 1 4 2 - This clause can be satisfied by setting 1 to true, 4 to true and 2 to false.
5. -4 1 2 - This clause can be satisfied by setting 4 to false, 1 to true and 2 to false.
6. -3 1 -5 - This clause can be satisfied by setting 3 to false, 1 to true and 5 to false.
7. -3 1 -4 - This clause can be satisfied by setting 3 to false, 1 to true and 4 to false.
8. -3 1 4 - This clause can be satisfied by setting 3 to false, 1 to true and 4 to true.
9. -4 3 5 - This clause can be satisfied by setting 4 to false, 3 to true and 5 to true.
10. -3 -4 -2 - This clause can be satisfied by setting 3 to false, 4 to false and 2 to false.
11. -5 2 -4 - This clause can be satisfied by setting 5 to false, 2 to true and 4 to false.
12. -1 -5 2 - This clause can be satisfied by setting 1 to false, 5 to false and 2 to true.
13. 1 -4 3 - This clause can be satisfied by setting 1 to true, 4 to false and 3 to true.
14. -5 -1 -4 - This clause can be satisfied by setting 5 to false, 1 to false and 4 to false.
15. -1 -3 -5 - This clause can be satisfied by setting 1 to false, 3 to false and 5 to false.
16. 5 -4 1 - This clause can be satisfied by setting 5 to true, 4 to false and 1 to true.
17. -4 1 2 - This clause can be satisfied by setting 4 to false, 1 to true and 2 to true.
18. 3 2 -5 - This clause can be satisfied by setting 3 to true, 2 to true and 5 to false.

Therefore, a satisfying assignment that makes the formula true is:
1. x1 = 1
2. x2 = 1
3. x3 = 0
4. x4 = 0
5. x5 = 0

answer: x1=1, x2=1, x3=0, x4=0, x5=0
