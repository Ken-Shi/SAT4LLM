We need to solve the SAT problem encoded in CNF format. The problem has 5 variables and 18 clauses.

To solve this, we can use a SAT solver or manually go through the clauses to see if a solution can be found. 

Looking at the clauses, we can see that some variables appear multiple times in different combinations. By analyzing the given CNF, a solution can be obtained. 

The final answer is: 
answer: 1 -2 3 4 5
