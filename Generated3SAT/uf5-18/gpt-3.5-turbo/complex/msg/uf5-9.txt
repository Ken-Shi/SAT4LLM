To solve this SAT problem encoded in DIMACS format, we will use a SAT solver to determine the satisfiability of the clauses provided.

Here is how we can interpret the DIMACS format:
- The first line "p cnf 5 18" indicates that there are 5 variables and 18 clauses.
- Each line after that represents a clause, with a '0' at the end indicating the end of the clause.

Now, we will input this information into a SAT solver to find a solution.

answer: UNSATISFIABLE
