A positive number means the corresponding variable is true and a negative number means it is false.\n\nThe first step is to find pure literals. A pure literal is a variable that always appears either in positive form or in negative form in all clauses. \n\nThe variable 4 is a pure literal as it is always in positive form, 4. Thus, let's set x4 = TRUE. \n\nAfter that, look for unit clauses. A unit clause only contains a single literal. But there's no unit clause after setting x4 = TRUE, so we choose to set one of the variables.\n\nLet's choose x2 since it appears the most frequently. We set x2 = TRUE. \n\nIt's time to simplify the clauses according to the values we set. Note: the clauses -4 -1 3 0, 4 -1 3 0 does not get simplified because when x4 is TRUE, these clauses would just be ignored.\n\nGo through the revised clauses, we find two unit clauses: -1 and -3. Therefore, set x1=FALSE and x3=FALSE.\n\nThere is only one variable left, x5. We will make a decision on it based on the clauses. Clause -5 -1 -3 0 becomes -5 0 after simplification. Thus, we set x5 = TRUE.\n\nAnswer: x1=FALSE, x2=TRUE, x3=FALSE, x4=TRUE, x5=TRUE."
