                "content": "This problem is a propositional satisfiability problem in Conjunctive Normal Form. SAT solvers automates the procedure of solving, though a trace of manual resolution can be provided. Each line in the format after \"p cnf 5 18\" represents a disjunction of literals (Clauses), where positive numbers denote truth assignment of literals and negative numbers the negations of the corresponding variable.\n\n1. Starting with a basic unit propagations and finding pure literals will not work in this case.\n\n2. Upon inspection, every clause contains -3 or 1 or both, except one clause \"2 4 5 0\". So, if we set all three literals in this clause to True, every clause should be satisfiable. \n\n3. Now we perform the Unit Propagation: After setting the literals to True, resulting simplified SAT Problem has no clauses left unsettled; that means our assignment indeed satisfies all clauses and hence the whole CNF formula.\n\nTherefore, the solution is 2 = T, 4 = T, 5 = T and other variables can take any value, because they do not affect the satisfiability.\n\nAnswer: 1=F/1=T, 2=T, 3=F/3=T, 4=T, 5=T"
