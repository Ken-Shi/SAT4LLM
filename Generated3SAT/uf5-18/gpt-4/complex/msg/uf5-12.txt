This problem defines a boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) within a conjunctive normal form (CNF). To solve this problem, we can use a SAT solver but here I'll explain how it might be done manually by inspecting the clauses (lines).

The idea is to find a solution which satisfies all the clauses on all the lines. A common heuristic called unit clause propagation could be used, which looks for clauses that only contains one variable (referred as unit clause), for our case we do not have any unit clause.

However, we can still analyze the multi-variable clauses and make educated guess to start finding the solution. Variables in a clause are separated by space and lines end with 0. Positive numbers mean the variable has to be true, negative numbers mean the variable has to be false to satisfy the clause.

Let's analyze the clauses:
1. The 1st clause "-1 2 5 0" suggests that var1 is false OR var2 is true OR var5 is true, and so on.

By applying another heuristic called Pure Literal Rule (if a variable or it's negative appears in a pure form (meaning appears only as positive or negative, not both) throughout all clauses, then it's assigned the value that makes all clauses containing this variable true).

Looking at our clauses, one such variable is variable 3 since it always appears as positive. So we can assign it to be true.

When var3 is true, all clauses containing var3 are satisfied. So we remove those clauses and delete the var3 from remaining clauses.

Similarly, we see that literal 2 is pure and negative. So we can assign var2 to be false. After this step, all remaining clauses have at most two variables.

Then, we see that literal 5 is pure and positive. So we can assign var5 to be true.

After all these, we get reduced clauses from which we see the literal 1 is pure and positive. This means we assign var1 to be true.

Finally, literal 4 is pure and it's location says it is false. So we assign var4 to be false.

**answer: Variable assignments are -1, -2, 3, -4, 5**
