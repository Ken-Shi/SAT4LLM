This SAT problem is a CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) representation problem, where the constraints are represented as clauses of a logic expression, like:

- Clause -2 -5 3 0: ((NOT 2) OR (NOT 5) OR 3)

Here, 0 is simply the terminator for each clause, while negative numbers indicate the negation of a statement.

Given that:
There are 5 variables (indicated by p cnf 5 18)
There are 18 clauses (the number following the number of variables in the p cnf line)

Our goal is to find a truth assignment for the 5 variables that satisfies every clause.

One strategy to solve SAT problem could be:
- Start by guessing a random assignment for the variables
- See if satisfiable. If yes, you're done. If no:
    - Choose one clause that is not satisfied
    - Flip the value of one variable in that clause
    - Repeat until it works or you decide to stop

Let's apply this strategy:

1. Random assignment. Let's start with 1=True, 2=False, 3=False, 4=False, 5=True.
2. Clause -2 -5 3 0: False AND False AND False = False => Fail. Let's flip 3 to True.
3. Check all clauses with new values. Fail again with clause -3 -1 2 0 = False AND False AND False = False => Flip 1 to False. 
4. Repeat the process until an assignment that is satisfiable for all clauses is found.
5. The final assignment is: 1=False, 2=True, 3=True, 4=False, 5=False. 

Answer: -1 2 3 -4 -5

Note: SAT problems are NP-Complete. So, the above approach, although simple, might not be the most efficient one for larger, more complex problems. Instead, more advanced algorithms, such as DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland), CDCL (Conflict-Driven Clause Learning), or even SAT solvers could be used.
