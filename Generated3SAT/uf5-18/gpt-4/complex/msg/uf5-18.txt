First, we have to understand that in DIMACS format, a positive integer represents a variable and a negative integer represents the negation of a variable. Here, we have 5 variables (since "p cnf 5 18" means we are dealing with 5 variables in the expressions) across 18 clauses.

The first line of each expression represents "variable 5 OR variable 2 OR NOT variable 4". The SAT problem can be viewed as a logic problem where each clause (each line of expressions) needs to be true for the solution to hold.

We start by making an assumption and then checking the results. From the units clause, I see that 5 appears many times. Therefore, I assume that 5 and -5 both are true. Then, we just need to ensure the clauses are all satisfied.

From line 1 and line 2, we see that 5 AND -4 AND 2 is true. 

Checking for clauses with 1, we see that from line 3, and line 4, (2 AND 1 AND -3) AND (-5 AND 1 AND -3) is also true. 

The next few lines are bit tricky. Line 5 and line 6 say (-4 AND 2 AND -5) AND (2 AND 5 AND -4) which returns true. 

Line 7 and line 8 present the clauses (5 AND 2 AND -1) AND (2 AND 1 AND 5). Checking with our previous assumptions, we see that these are true. 

Finally, we ensure all variables appear. We already took into account variables 1, 2, 4, and 5. From line 12, we validate variable 3.

Answer: 1=true, 2=true, 3=false, 4=false, 5=true
