In SAT problems, we're looking to find a solution where every clause (a line in DIMACS) is true. 'p cnf 5 18' is the header and tells us the problem is in Conjunctive Normal Form with 5 variables and 18 clauses. 

Each line until '0' specifies a clause where we need at least one of the elements in the clause to be true. Each number represents a variable, and if the variable is negative, it means we're considering its negation.

The operation we use is, for each clause, find a variable that does not have its negation in the approach to build a solution. If such a variable is found, put the variable to true, else, backtrack. Backtracking involves changing the last assigned variable to false. If no variable is available for backtracking, the problem has no solution.

Now, scroll through each clause from top to bottom. Take the first clause '1 -2 4 0'. Since 1 and 4 are positive and do not have their negations elsewhere, we can set them to true and proceed.

Then, come to the second clause '4 -5 -2 0'. Since 4 is already true, this clause is already satisfied. So, keep going.

For clause '5 -1 -3 0', 5 does not have its negation anywhere, set 5 true as well. Notice that -3 has not been assigned either true or false yet, leave it for now.

Following this process, we'll start building a solution. Going through all clauses, we end up having to backtrack when we're unable to find any unassigned variable. From the DIMACS data, 3 appears to be a possible candidate for backtracking.

Eventually, after setting values of variables from this backtracking process, we achieve a possible solution. 

Answer: 1=TRUE, 2=FALSE, 3=FALSE, 4=TRUE, 5=TRUE
