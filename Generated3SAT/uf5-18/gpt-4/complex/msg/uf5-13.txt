This is a set of boolean expressions, specified in conjunctive normal form (CNF). The problem is essentially asking us to assign either 'true' or 'false' to each of these variables such that every clause in the 18 clauses given evaluate to 'true'. It is essentially a problem of satisfiability (hence SAT), hence we need to find a valid satisfying assignment for these clauses.

Line of thoughts:
- 5 variables are used in this problem; 1 to 5 (both positive and negatives indicating true and false)
- If a variable appears as negative in a clause, it means that the clause is true if this variable is false. Vice versa, if a variable is positive in a clause, it means that the clause is true if this variable is true
- Each clause is a disjunction of literals (variables or their negations), hence the clause is true if at least one of the literals is true.
- With the above points in mind, one might start testing different settings of the 5 variables hoping to satisfy all clauses at once.

A more systematic way to solve this is to use backtracking, making a choice for one variable and checking if a contradiction occurs. In case of contradiction, backtrack and try a different setting of the variable. This method is used by lots of software solvers for SAT problems.

Testing these possibilities, a satisfying solution is found: 

Answer: 1 -2 3 -4 -5

This means that variable 1 is true, variables 2,4,5 are false and variable 3 is true. The rest of the clauses have at least one true value and no contradiction occurs. This is only one of the possible solutions, but as per SAT problem statements, only one valid solution is needed.
