In this problem, we are asked to find a solution to the given SAT problem. This problem is encoded in DIMACS format, which is a standard format used in SAT solver. The first line indicates that there are 5 different boolean variables, and 18 clauses (lines including boolean variables). The `0` at the end of each line define the boundary of a clause. 

The general approach to solve a SAT problem is by guessing and checking, and it's typically done by a computer program because the number of possibilities can be quite large. It's a NP-complete problem meaning no efficient solving algorithm is known. But here for the given case number of variable is small, So we can manually find out solution.   

Let's see what each of these clauses implies:

- `1 -5 4 0` : Either 1 is true, or -5 is true (so 5 is false), or 4 is true.
- `-2 1 4 0` : Either 2 is false or 1 is true, or 4 is true.
- `2 -1 -5 0` : Either 2 is true or 1 is false or 5 is false.

We can extract similar implications from all of the clauses. If we try to satisfy all of these clauses at once, we can see a possible assignment could be: 

- Variable 1 being true
- Variable 2 being true
- Variable 3 being true
- Variable 4 being true
- Variable 5 being false

This assignment satisfies all conditions.

Answer: 1 2 3 4 -5
