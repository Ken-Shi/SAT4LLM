This problem is a propositional logic problem that can be solved using a method called the DPLL (Davis, Putnam, Logemann, Loveland) algorithm, a specific form of backtracking search that is mostly used in the field of SAT (satisfiability) solving.

The problem has 5 variables and 18 clauses, each clause consisting of various literals (the variables or their negations). The aim is to find a truth assignment for these variables that satisfies all the clauses.

Each clause clause meaning OR between its literals and the entire formula meaning AND between its clauses.

Thinking through solving: Initially we need to look for any unit clauses, i.e., clauses that contain a single literal, but there are none in this formula. 

Next, we look for pure literals, i.e., literals that always appear with the same polarity in all clauses. But, there are no pure literals in this formula.

Since there are neither unit clauses nor pure literals, we are forced to pick a variable and assign it a boolean value. Let's pick 1 and set it to true. Propagating this value we get unit clause -4 from the first clause and unit clause -5 from the fourth clause. 

Next, if 4 is false, from the first clause we have 2 is true, but considering the rest of the clauses doesn't give any further units.

Then if 5 is false, but we got no further units. 

So, by trying assignments recursively, try another assignment, let's try setting 2 to true. But again no further units.

So, try setting 2 to false instead, we get another assignment 3 to false from 11th clause.

Then values for the literals 1=true, 4=false, 5=false, 2=false, 3=false satisfies all clauses, thus it is the solution.

Answer: 1=true, 4=false, 5=false, 2=false, 3=false.
