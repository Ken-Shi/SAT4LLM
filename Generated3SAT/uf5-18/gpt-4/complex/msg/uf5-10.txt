This problem is a propositional logic problem formatted in a conjunctive normal form (CNF) which is the format DIMACS uses. Each line represents a clause of the CNF formula and 0 marks the end of each clause. The problem is to find a satisfying assignment, if one exists.

The approach I will take is to look at individual clauses to draw conclusions on the satisfying assignment.

The first clause (5 -2 3 0) tells us that either 5 is true, -2 is true (which means 2 is false), or 3 is true.

Looking at other clauses, we can see that 5 appears in every clause. This signals that setting 5 to true will satisfy all clauses containing it.

After setting 5 to true, we can ignore any clauses where 5 appears by itself, but still need to consider clauses where -5 is an element. 

The clause (-4 -1 -5 0) tells us that either -4 is true (4 is false), -1 is true (1 is false), or -5 is true (5 is false). Since we've already determined that 5 is true, this implies that either 4 is false or 1 is false. 

Looking at the clause (4 5 1 0), we can see that this clause is already satisfied by setting 5 to true. That means setting 1 to false from the clause where -5 is an element does not contradict any other clause.

For the variables 2 and 3, looking at the entire CNF formula we can find that they can be assigned either true or false and still satisfy the formula.

Finally, the solution which will satisfy all clauses of the CNF formula is:

Answer: 
1. variable 5 = true
2. variable 4 = false
3. variable 1 = false
4. variable 2 = can be either true or false
5. variable 3 = can be either true or false
