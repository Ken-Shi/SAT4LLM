In order to solve this problem, we will use the method of DPLL (Davis?Putnam?Logemann?Loveland) which is a complete, backtracking-based search algorithm for deciding the satisfiability of propositional logic formulae in conjunctive normal form. 

Firstly, literal 4 shows up in negative form for the first time and then in the positive form, which gives us an opportunity to use the law of excluded middle and perform a case analysis. If we initially assume that 4=true, our conflicts are:
(-4 -5 -3 0) -> -5 -3 0
(-3 -2 -4 0) -> -3 -2 0
(-4 1 -5 0) -> 1 -5 0
(-4 -5 3 0) -> -5 3 0
(1 -4 3 0) -> 1 3 0
(-4 -5 -3 0) -> -5 -3 0
(-4 2 -3 0) -> 2 -3 0
(-4 -2 5 0) -> -2 5 0
(-5 -3 -4 0) -> -5 -3 0
(-4 1 -3 0) -> 1 -3 0
(1 -2 -4 0) -> 1 -2 0
(-4 1 -2 0) -> 1 -2 0
(-2 -4 -3 0) -> -2 -3 0

We can see that literal 1 has the same conflict that we had with 4. Therefore, if we set 1=false, we get no conflicts.

Therefore, this clause is satisfiable if we assign 4=true, 1=false and the remaining clauses can be either true/false as there is no restriction for them.

Answer: 4=true, 1=false, 2=Any, 3=Any, 5=Any
