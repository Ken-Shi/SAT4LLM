This problem belongs to the class of Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SAT), specifically it's an instance of the CNF SAT problem, where the objective is to find an assignment for the 5 variables such that all clauses (i.e. lines) become true. If such assignment exists, the problem is said to be satisfiable, otherwise it is unsatisfiable.

Before solving, let's understand the problem's format. Each line corresponds to a clause. The format has rules like the integers represent the variables. If the integer is negative, then the variable it represents should be false to satisfy the clause. If the integer is positive, then the variable it represents should be true to satisfy the clause. Every clause ends with a zero.

One common approach for solving a SAT problem is backtracking, but it can become unfeasible for larger problems. More sophisticated approaches use algorithms such as the DPLL algorithm which employs resolution and pruning techniques. Notably, today many SAT solvers are available that use complex heuristics for choosing the next variable to assign and backtrack efficiently. Well-known examples include MiniSAT, Z3, etc.

Let's solve it manually using the guess and check approach. 

Let's start by examining the clauses. 
Start with first clause "5 -3 4 0". There are two options for this:
- 5=True, -3=False, 4=True. Any of these can satisfy the clause.
Continuing in this manner for all clauses, there are multiple options. You just have to find one set of True/False assignments that makes every clause true.

I got the scenario where:
- 1=True
- 2=True
- 3=False 
- 4=False 
- 5=True 

You can see that this satisfies all the clauses.

Answer: 1=True, 2=True, 3=False, 4=False, 5=True.
