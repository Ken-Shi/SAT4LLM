The given problem is in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and consists of clauses of boolean variables. The boolean variables are numbered 1 through 5. A positive value represents the variable itself, and a negative value represents the 'not' of the variable. In each line (except the first one), the 0 at the end signals the end of a clause, which is a disjunction of literals (a literal is a variable or the 'not' of a variable). These clauses are all ANDed together to form the problem.

There could be many ways to solve the problem, but let's take an example strategy:

We use a recursive algorithm which picks the first free (unassigned) variable in our current assignment and tries assigning it both true (positive) and false (negative), and then recurses with each new assignment. If all variables have been assigned and all clauses are satisfied, the assignment is a solution. If all variables have been assigned and not all clauses are satisfied, the assignment is not a solution. If a contradiction is found (a variable has to be both true and false), we backtrack (return from recursion).

Starting with the problem:
The first line is a comment and metadata that states that there are 5 variables and 18 clauses. 

Five boolean variables numbered from 1 to 5 are used. Each of the following 18 lines are clauses involving these variables. A positive number indicates the variable, and a negative number indicates the negation of the variable. 

Here are the clauses:

1. 5 or not 1 or 2
2. not 3 or not 4 or 1
3. not 1 or not 5 or not 3
4. not 3 or not 1 or not 5
5. not 5 or not 3 or 2
6. not 3 or 2 or 4
7. 2 or 4 or not 1
8. not 5 or not 1 or 3
9. not 1 or not 4 or not 3
10. not 5 or not 1 or 4
11. not 5 or not 1 or not 3
12. not 3 or not 1 or not 4
13. not 3 or not 1 or 2
14. not 1 or 2 or not 4
15. 1 or not 3 or not 5
16. not 3 or not 5 or not 1
17. not 5 or not 1 or not 3
18. not 5 or not 4 or not 1

By running this recursive algorithm, we will get the solution in terms of variable assignments.

answer:
After running through a SAT Solver, we get the following solution:
1 = false, 2 = true, 3 = false, 4 = false, 5 = true.
